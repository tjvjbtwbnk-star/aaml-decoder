**Subject:** Grid Connection Interface - Data Request
---

Dear Stefan,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing regarding the electrical interface with the national grid and some data we require from the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to progress our detailed electrical design.

**Background:**

As you know, the grid connection for BCCPP is via a new 400 kV line to Szohôd North Substation, which is being constructed under a separate contract. Our design is progressing well, but we have reached a point where we need specific technical data from the TSO to finalise several critical aspects.

**Data Required:**

We request the following information from the TSO:

| Item | Description | Required For |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Grid fault level at Szohôd North (prospective short-circuit current) | Switchgear specification and protection settings |
| 2 | Grid impedance data (R and X values) | Stability studies and harmonic analysis |
| 3 | Protection coordination requirements | Interface protection design |
| 4 | Frequency and voltage operating ranges | Generator AVR and governor settings |
| 5 | Reactive power requirements (P-Q diagram) | Generator capability specification |
| 6 | Grid code compliance requirements | Testing and commissioning procedures |
| 7 | SCADA interface protocol and point list | Control system design |
| 8 | Synchronisation requirements | Generator breaker specification |

**Urgency:**

Items 1-3 are required urgently for Basic Design completion (Batch 4). We have used assumed values based on typical grid characteristics, but these assumptions need to be verified.

Items 4-8 are required for Detailed Design, with target completion by August 2019.

**Contract Position:**

I understand from the Contract that BEU is responsible for providing interface data from third parties, including the TSO (Employer's Requirements, Section 5.3.2). We have not received any TSO data to date.

**Request:**

Could you please:

1. Confirm the point of contact at the TSO for technical interface matters
2. Advise on the process for obtaining the required data
3. Provide an expected timeline for receiving the information

Alternatively, if BEU can facilitate a technical meeting with the TSO, we would be happy to present our requirements directly.

**Programme Impact:**

If the data for Items 1-3 is not received by 31 May 2019, there is a risk that Batch 4 approval will be delayed, as DPI may not be able to confirm the protection and switchgear design without verified fault level data.

Items 4-8, if delayed beyond July 2019, could impact detailed electrical design and potentially affect the commissioning programme.

I would be grateful if you could advise on the way forward at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
