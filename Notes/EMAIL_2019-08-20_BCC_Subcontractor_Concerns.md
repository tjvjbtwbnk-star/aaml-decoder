**Subject:** Subcontractor Performance Concerns - BCC
---

Dear Miroslav,

I am writing to formally raise the Employer's concerns regarding the performance of Borduria Civil Contractors (BCC), the civil works subcontractor.

**1. Background**

As you are aware, BCC's performance has been a topic of discussion at recent Weekly Progress Meetings. The issues have now reached a level where I consider it necessary to put our concerns in writing.

**2. Specific Concerns**

**2.1 Resource Shortfall**

| Date | Committed Personnel | Actual Personnel | Shortfall |
|------|---------------------|------------------|-----------|
| 12 Aug | 125 | 97 | 28 (22%) |
| 14 Aug | 125 | 103 | 22 (18%) |
| 16 Aug | 120 | 108 | 12 (10%) |
| 19 Aug | 120 | 112 | 8 (7%) |

While there has been some improvement, BCC has consistently failed to deliver the committed resource levels. The Recovery Programme is predicated on these resources being available.

**2.2 Productivity**

Based on Branko Simić's observations:

| Activity | Planned Rate | Actual Rate | Variance |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Formwork installation | 65 m²/day | 52 m²/day | -20% |
| Rebar fixing | 12 t/day | 9 t/day | -25% |
| General civil works | - | - | Est. -15% overall |

**2.3 Quality Observations**

While no formal NCRs have been raised, there have been several observations regarding:
- Formwork joint gaps
- Inconsistent release agent application
- Construction joint preparation
- Housekeeping

**3. Contractual Implications**

3.1 Under Sub-Clause 4.4 of the Contract, the Contractor is responsible for the acts and defaults of its subcontractors.

3.2 Under Sub-Clause 8.6, if progress is too slow to achieve completion within the Time for Completion, the Employer may instruct the Contractor to take measures to expedite progress.

3.3 The Contractor's failure to ensure adequate subcontractor performance may constitute a failure to proceed with due expedition and without delay, contrary to Sub-Clause 8.1.

**4. Employer's Expectations**

4.1 **Immediate:** BCC must achieve and maintain the committed resource levels (minimum 120 personnel) from this week.

4.2 **Productivity:** Targeted productivity improvement measures must be implemented. We expect to see formwork installation rates improve to at least 60 m²/day within one week.

4.3 **Quality:** Enhanced supervision and quality control measures must be implemented to address the observations noted.

4.4 **Reporting:** Daily headcount and productivity reports must continue to be provided.

**5. Action Required**

5.1 Please provide by **23 August 2019**:

(a) Confirmation of actions taken with BCC to address resource shortfall;
(b) Analysis of productivity shortfall and improvement measures;
(c) Confirmation of enhanced quality control measures;
(d) Contingency plan in case BCC fails to improve performance.

5.2 We also request a meeting with BCC management (Mr. Đurić) at the next WPM to discuss these matters directly.

**6. Reservation of Rights**

6.1 The Employer reserves all rights under the Contract in respect of any delays or additional costs arising from subcontractor underperformance.

6.2 This letter is without prejudice to the Employer's position on the cause of delays to the Foundation Completion milestone.

I trust you will give this matter the urgent attention it requires.

Best regards,
