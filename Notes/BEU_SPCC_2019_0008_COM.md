**Subject: Response to Claim for Extension of Time - Delayed Site Access (DE-001)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Your Ref: SPCC/BEU/2019/0010-COM dated 4 April 2019**

Dear Mr. Procházka,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

We refer to your claim for Extension of Time dated 4 April 2019 in respect of the delayed access to the north-eastern portion of the Site (Discovery Event DE-001).

The Employer has carefully reviewed your submission and the supporting documentation. Our position is set out below.

**2. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**

2.1 The Employer acknowledges that:

(a) Full Site access was provided on 2 April 2019, being 60 calendar days after the contractual date of 1 February 2019;

(b) The restricted access to the 2.1 hectare NE area was due to an unresolved boundary easement matter with the adjacent landowner;

(c) The Contractor gave timely notice of this matter on 18 February 2019 in accordance with the Contract.

**3. EMPLOYER'S ANALYSIS**

3.1 Notwithstanding the above acknowledgement, the Employer does not accept the claimed Extension of Time of 45 days. Our analysis is as follows:

**Area Affected:**

3.2 The excluded NE area represents 8.4% of the total Site area (2.1 hectares of 25 hectares). This area was designated for secondary activities including laydown, temporary access, and stormwater infrastructure - not critical path works.

**Activities Claimed:**

3.3 The Contractor claims delays to ground investigation, topsoil stripping, mass excavation, and storm drainage. However:

(a) **Ground Investigation:** The original programme showed 24 boreholes across the Site. Of these, only 2 boreholes (BH-17 and BH-18) were located in the NE area. The remaining 22 boreholes could proceed unaffected. The claimed 43-day delay to this activity is excessive.

(b) **Topsoil Stripping / Mass Excavation:** The NE area earthworks are not on the critical path. The baseline programme shows these works as independent of the main plant area activities with substantial float.

(c) **Storm Drainage:** While storm drainage infrastructure is located in the NE area, this work has substantial float (approximately 45 days per the Contractor's own programme).

**Critical Path Analysis:**

3.4 The Contractor's Time Impact Analysis (Appendix A to your submission) does not demonstrate that the NE area works are on the critical path. The critical path runs through design approvals, major equipment procurement and delivery, and main plant foundation construction - none of which were affected by the NE area access restriction.

**Mitigation:**

3.5 The Contract requires the Contractor to use best endeavours to prevent and mitigate delay. The Employer notes that:

(a) The Contractor did not propose or implement a re-sequencing of works to utilise the accessible 91.6% of the Site;

(b) No acceleration measures were proposed;

(c) Ground investigation in other areas proceeded without apparent constraint.

**4. EMPLOYER'S DETERMINATION**

4.1 Based on the above analysis, the Employer determines that:

(a) The claimed 45-day Extension of Time is **not substantiated**;

(b) The delay to NE area access did not affect the critical path of the Works;

(c) Any impact on float does not constitute an entitlement to Extension of Time under the Contract.

4.2 Accordingly, the Employer **rejects** the claimed Extension of Time in its entirety.

**5. COST CLAIM**

5.1 We note your reservation of rights to claim additional costs. For the avoidance of doubt, if a cost claim is submitted, the Employer's position will be consistent with the analysis above - namely that the NE area access did not cause critical delay and therefore prolongation costs are not substantiated.

**6. CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSE**

6.1 If the Contractor disagrees with this determination, the Contractor may refer the matter to the Engineer for determination under Sub-Clause 3.5.

6.2 Alternatively, the Contractor may submit additional information or analysis in support of its claim. The Employer remains open to reviewing any additional substantiation that the Contractor may wish to provide.

**7. WITHOUT PREJUDICE**

7.1 This response is provided without prejudice to the Employer's rights under the Contract and is subject to further review as the matter develops.

Yours sincerely,

**Ana Nikolić**
