**Subject:** Site establishment - temporary facilities status

Dear Branko,

Following yesterday's PMM meeting in Klow, I wanted to send you a quick update on our site establishment status now that we're essentially complete with the mobilisation phase.

**Site Establishment - Final Status:**

✓ Site offices: 400m² modular offices - fully operational  
✓ Welfare facilities: Changing rooms, toilets, canteen for 50 people - operational  
✓ Security: Fencing, gate, access control - complete  
✓ Temporary utilities: Power (200 kVA), water, communications - all connected  
✓ Storage compound: 5,000m² fenced and organized - ready for materials  
✓ Site roads: Graded and improved for heavy vehicle access  
✓ Waste management: Segregated collection points established  
✓ Safety facilities: First aid station, emergency assembly point, fire extinguishers  
✓ Site signage: Safety, wayfinding, project information - complete  

**Site Layout:**

The attached site plan shows the current layout of temporary facilities. Key features:
- Site office and welfare facilities: NE corner (as planned)
- Storage compound: Central area with good access from main gate
- Drilling operations: Mobile across site as boreholes are completed
- Parking: 25 spaces currently, will expand as personnel increase

**Capacity and Future Expansion:**

Current facilities are sized for Phase 1 (mobilisation and early works):
- Office capacity: 25 people
- Welfare capacity: 50 people
- Current occupancy: 22 office, ~30 site

We will need to expand for the civil works phase (May onwards):
- Additional office modules: +200m² (for civil works team and increased engineering)
- Welfare expansion: To accommodate 150-200 workers
- Laydown areas: Additional 10,000m² for civil works materials and equipment
- Concrete batching plant: To be established April/May (location TBC)

I'll send you a proposed expansion plan in March once we finalize the civil works subcontract and understand their specific requirements.

**Utilities Usage - January/February:**

For your records, here's our consumption during mobilisation:
- Electricity: ~8,500 kWh (well within 200 kVA available capacity)
- Water: ~120 m³ (mainly welfare facilities)
- No issues with temporary connections - working well

**Site Condition:**

Overall the site is in excellent condition:
- Good drainage (no standing water despite some rainy weather)
- Ground conditions are firm enough for construction traffic
- Access roads are holding up well
- No environmental issues observed

**Looking Ahead:**

Next phase activities (March-April):
- Continue ground investigation (complete by 7 March)
- Prepare for civil works contractor mobilisation
- Expand temporary facilities as needed
- Begin site enabling works (drainage, leveling)

Thanks for your support during the mobilisation. The site handover process was smooth and BEU's provision of temporary utilities has worked well.

Let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any site management issues from BEU's perspective.

Best regards,
