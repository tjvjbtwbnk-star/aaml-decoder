**Subject: Request for Variation - Additional Ground Investigation (VO-001)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 13.3 (Variation Procedure)**

Dear Ms. Nikolić,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 13.3 of the Conditions of Contract, we hereby submit a request for a Variation Order to cover the cost of additional ground investigation works undertaken in response to the unforeseeable ground conditions encountered at the Site.

**2. BACKGROUND**

2.1 The Contractor encountered unforeseeable ground conditions during the planned ground investigation programme, as notified to the Employer under Sub-Clause 4.12 on 28 March 2019 (Reference: SPCC/BEU/2019/0009-TEC) and supplemented on 9 April 2019 (Reference: SPCC/BEU/2019/0011-TEC).

2.2 The discovery of an artesian aquifer and contaminated soil conditions in the Turbine Hall area required immediate additional investigation to delineate the extent and characteristics of these conditions.

2.3 This additional investigation was essential to:

(a) Characterise the extent of the aquifer and artesian pressure;
(b) Delineate the contaminated soil zone;
(c) Enable design of appropriate foundation solutions;
(d) Support remediation planning;
(e) Comply with regulatory requirements.

2.4 The additional investigation works were carried out between 29 March 2019 and 7 April 2019.

**3. SCOPE OF ADDITIONAL WORKS**

The additional ground investigation works comprised:

| Item | Description | Quantity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Mobilisation of drilling rig (emergency call-out) | 1 no. |
| 2 | Additional boreholes (BH-25 to BH-30) | 6 no. |
| 3 | Drilling to 15-20m depth | 105 lin.m |
| 4 | Continuous sampling with U100 and SPT | 210 samples |
| 5 | Piezometer installation | 4 no. |
| 6 | Groundwater sampling | 8 samples |
| 7 | Laboratory testing - geotechnical | 95 tests |
| 8 | Laboratory testing - contamination (BETS) | 48 analyses |
| 9 | Aquifer pumping test | 1 no. |
| 10 | Technical reporting and interpretation | 1 LS |

**4. CONTRACT PROVISIONS**

4.1 The original Contract scope included a ground investigation programme of 24 boreholes as specified in the Employer's Requirements (Volume 2, Section 3.4).

4.2 The additional 6 boreholes and associated testing were not included in the original scope and represent additional work required to address unforeseeable conditions.

4.3 Under Sub-Clause 4.12(c), the Engineer shall proceed to agree or determine the matters described in Sub-Clause 3.5 arising from unforeseeable physical conditions.

4.4 Under Sub-Clause 13.1, the Employer may at any time issue an instruction for a Variation, and additional investigation works to address unforeseen conditions fall within the definition of Variation.

**5. COST BREAKDOWN**

The cost of the additional ground investigation works is as follows:

| Item | Description | Amount (EUR) |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 5.1 | BGS Drilling Subcontract (emergency mobilisation + drilling) | 68,500 |
| 5.2 | BETS Laboratory Testing (contamination analyses) | 24,200 |
| 5.3 | Geotechnical Laboratory Testing | 18,400 |
| 5.4 | Piezometer Installation and Equipment | 12,600 |
| 5.5 | Aquifer Pumping Test | 8,800 |
| 5.6 | Technical Supervision (SPCC staff) | 15,400 |
| 5.7 | Reporting and Interpretation | 22,500 |
| | **Subtotal** | **170,400** |
| 5.8 | Contractor's Overheads and Profit (15%) | 25,560 |
| | **TOTAL** | **195,960** |

Say: **EUR 196,000** (One Hundred Ninety-Six Thousand Euros)

**6. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION**

The following documents are attached in support of this Variation Request:

- Appendix A: BGS Drilling Subcontract Invoice and Breakdown
- Appendix B: BETS Laboratory Invoice and Test Schedule
- Appendix C: Additional Borehole Location Plan
- Appendix D: Work Records and Timesheets
- Appendix E: Technical Reports TR-003 and TR-004

**7. PROGRAMME**

No extension of time is claimed specifically for the additional ground investigation works, as these were carried out in parallel with the investigation of remediation options. Programme implications of the underlying ground conditions are addressed separately.

**8. REQUEST**

We respectfully request that the Engineer:

8.1 Confirms that the additional ground investigation works constitute a Variation under the Contract;

8.2 Issues a Variation Order (VO-001) for the sum of EUR 196,000;

8.3 Alternatively, provides any amendments to the above evaluation in accordance with Sub-Clause 12.3.

We are available to discuss this request and provide any additional information that may be required for evaluation.

Yours sincerely,

**Jiří Procházka**
