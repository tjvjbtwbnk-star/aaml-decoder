# LETTER

**BORDURIA ENERGY UTILITIES S.A.**  
42 Boulevard Marshal Douma  
Szohôd, Borduria

**Reference:** BEU/SPCC/2019/0005-COM  
**Date:** 21 February 2019

Jiří Procházka  
Commercial Manager  
Syldavian Power Construction Consortium  
15 Ottokar IV Boulevard  
Klow, Syldavia

Dear Mr. Procházka,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – RESPONSE TO NOTICE UNDER SUB-CLAUSE 2.1 - DELAYED SITE ACCESS (NORTHEASTERN AREA)

We acknowledge receipt of your letter ref. SPCC/BEU/2019/0005-COM dated 18 February 2019, constituting formal notice under Sub-Clause 20.1 of the Contract in respect of delayed provision of site access to the northeastern area.

This letter constitutes BEU's formal response to your notice and sets out our position on the matter.

---

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FACTS

BEU acknowledges the following facts as stated in your letter:

1. Site possession was provided on 1 February 2019 by our letter ref. BEU/SPCC/2019/0002-GEN, but excluded approximately 2.1 hectares in the northeastern portion of the site.

2. The Contract required provision of full site possession from 1 February 2019 with no exclusions specified in the Appendix to Tender.

3. The exclusion was due to an unresolved boundary easement matter with the adjacent Klow Chemical Works facility.

4. SPCC's Ground Investigation Programme includes 6 boreholes within the excluded area.

5. BEU has arranged temporary access to the NE area for ground investigation drilling from 25 February to 8 March 2019.

6. Full permanent site possession of the NE area has not yet been provided.

---

## BEU'S POSITION ON LIABILITY

### Sub-Clause 2.1 Obligation

BEU acknowledges its obligation under Sub-Clause 2.1 to provide the Contractor with "right of access to, and possession of, all parts of the Site within the time (or times) stated in the Appendix to Tender."

The Appendix to Tender specified 1 February 2019 as the date for site possession, with no qualifications or exclusions noted.

**BEU accepts** that the provision of site possession excluding the 2.1 hectare NE area constitutes a partial non-performance of the Sub-Clause 2.1 obligation.

### Basis for Exclusion

While we accept the factual position, we wish to explain the circumstances:

The boundary easement matter with Klow Chemical Works arose from a title discrepancy that was only discovered during final due diligence in late January 2019. The issue relates to a historical boundary realignment that was not properly registered with the Bordurian Land Registry.

This was not a matter known to BEU at the time of Contract execution, nor was it reasonably foreseeable. BEU has acted promptly and diligently to resolve the matter since it came to light.

Nevertheless, BEU recognizes that the Contract places the risk of site access matters on the Employer, regardless of foreseeability. Sub-Clause 2.1 creates a strict obligation.

### Entitlement in Principle

BEU accepts that SPCC is **entitled in principle** to:
- Extension of Time for Completion, to the extent the Time for Completion is delayed by the failure to provide full site access, and/or
- Additional payment for Cost, to the extent SPCC incurs additional costs that are directly attributable to the failure to provide full site access

This entitlement is subject to:
- SPCC demonstrating actual delay to the Time for Completion and/or actual additional costs incurred
- Proper substantiation and quantification of any claim
- SPCC's duty to mitigate the impacts
- Compliance with Sub-Clause 20.1 procedural requirements (which have been satisfied by SPCC's notice of 18 February)

---

## BEU'S ASSESSMENT OF IMPACTS

While accepting entitlement in principle, BEU's preliminary assessment is that the actual impacts of the NE area access delay are likely to be **minimal or nil** for the following reasons:

### 1. Temporary Access Provided for Critical Activity

BEU has secured temporary access to the NE area for the period 25 February to 8 March 2019, specifically to allow ground investigation drilling in that area.

Based on discussions with SPCC's site team, we understand that:
- The main ground investigation drilling is progressing well and ahead of schedule
- The 6 NE area boreholes represent approximately 5 days of drilling work
- The temporary access period provides 10 working days (allowing 100% contingency)
- There is no indication that the ground investigation will be delayed overall

**Therefore:** The ground investigation, which is the only activity currently planned for the NE area, can be completed on schedule without material additional cost.

### 2. Permanent Access Before Area Required for Construction

BEU's current estimate is that permanent full access to the NE area will be provided by **mid-March 2019** (approximately 10 March subject to final legal formalities).

SPCC's programme indicates that construction activities in the NE area (drainage works, laydown areas, etc.) are not scheduled to commence until April 2019 at the earliest.

**Therefore:** Permanent access will be provided with adequate time before the area is needed for construction activities, and there should be no delay to the critical path.

### 3. Adequate Site Area Available for Early Works

The site area provided to SPCC (excluding the NE area) comprises approximately 22.9 hectares out of 25 hectares total (91.6% of the site).

This area has proven adequate for:
- Site mobilisation and establishment
- Ground investigation in main plant areas
- All activities planned for February and March 2019

**Therefore:** SPCC has had adequate site area to progress early works efficiently, and the exclusion has not materially impeded progress to date.

### 4. SPCC's Mitigation Measures

We note from SPCC's letter that you are "taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the impacts" including coordinating drilling operations efficiently and planning alternative arrangements.

We expect that these mitigation measures, combined with BEU's provision of temporary access and the imminent provision of permanent access, will substantially reduce or eliminate the impacts.

---

## PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF COSTS AND TIME

Subject to SPCC's detailed substantiation, BEU's preliminary assessment of potential entitlements is as follows:

### Extension of Time for Completion

**Preliminary Assessment:** **NIL**

**Basis:**
- Ground investigation can be completed on schedule (no delay)
- Permanent access will be provided by mid-March, well before NE area construction activities commence in April
- No activities on the critical path are affected
- No delay to the Time for Completion is anticipated

**Caveat:** This assessment is based on BEU achieving permanent access by mid-March as currently anticipated. If access is further delayed beyond mid-March, the assessment may change.

### Additional Costs

**Preliminary Assessment:** **Minor to moderate additional costs possible, but significantly less than SPCC's preliminary estimate**

**Basis:**
- Ground investigation drilling inefficiency may result in some additional costs, but these should be limited given the temporary access arrangement
- SPCC's preliminary estimate of EUR 25,000-40,000 for ground investigation additional costs appears high and will require detailed substantiation
- Other claimed impacts (site planning constraints, future works) are speculative at this stage and may not materialize if permanent access is provided by mid-March

**Estimated Range:** EUR 5,000 - 15,000 (subject to substantiation)

**Categories of cost that BEU would consider legitimate:**
- Actual demonstrated additional costs incurred by the drilling contractor due to the temporary access restrictions (e.g., standby time, mobilisation inefficiency) - supported by contractor invoices/quotes
- Reasonable additional SPCC supervision and management costs directly attributable to coordinating the split drilling campaign - quantified on a time basis
- Any demonstrable additional costs for preliminary works (e.g., temporary fencing, security arrangements) - supported by invoices

**Categories of cost that BEU would not accept:**
- Theoretical or estimated costs not actually incurred
- Costs that would have been incurred in any event
- General overhead or profit on claimed amounts
- Costs relating to speculative future impacts that do not materialize

---

## PROPOSED RESOLUTION APPROACH

BEU proposes the following approach to resolve this matter efficiently and amicably:

### 1. Joint Impact Assessment Meeting (22 February 2019)

As discussed at the weekly progress meeting (WPM-003) and in Ivana Petrović's email of 19 February, BEU proposes a joint meeting on Friday 22 February (afternoon, after BEU management site visit) to:

- Review SPCC's preliminary impact assessment
- Discuss actual vs. theoretical impacts
- Identify any further mitigation measures
- Explore basis for amicable resolution

Attendees:
- BEU: Ivana Petrović, Ana Nikolić, Dragan Kostić
- SPCC: Miroslav Horák, Jiří Procházka, Jan Sedláček (planning)
- Engineer: Dr. Heinrich Weber or Maria Santos (observer, if available)

### 2. SPCC Detailed Claim Substantiation (by 15 March 2019)

SPCC to provide detailed claim particulars as required by Sub-Clause 20.1, including:

**For Extension of Time claim:**
- Detailed programme analysis showing critical path impact
- Demonstration of actual delay to Time for Completion
- Evidence that mitigation measures are inadequate to avoid delay

**For additional Cost claim:**
- Itemized breakdown of additional costs
- Supporting documentation (contractor quotes/invoices, timesheets, etc.)
- Demonstration that costs are directly attributable to the NE area access delay
- Evidence that costs could not be avoided through reasonable mitigation

### 3. Good Faith Negotiations (March 2019)

BEU and SPCC to engage in good faith negotiations to reach agreement on:
- Actual entitlement to extension of time (if any)
- Quantum of additional costs (if any)
- Amicable resolution without requiring Engineer's formal determination

**Target:** Agreement by 31 March 2019

### 4. Referral to Engineer if Necessary

If the parties cannot reach agreement, the matter will be referred to the Engineer for determination under Sub-Clause 3.5, as is SPCC's right under the Contract.

---

## COMMITMENT TO PERMANENT ACCESS

BEU commits to the following:

1. **Target Date:** Full permanent unrestricted access to the NE area by **10 March 2019** (our best current estimate; maximum 15 March 2019).

2. **Progress Updates:** Weekly updates on easement negotiations to be provided to SPCC at weekly progress meetings.

3. **Immediate Notification:** If any issue arises that may delay permanent access beyond 15 March, BEU will notify SPCC immediately and discuss further mitigation measures.

4. **Documentation:** Upon achieving permanent access, BEU will provide formal written confirmation to SPCC and update the site possession documentation accordingly.

---

## BEU'S POSITION - SUMMARY

In summary, BEU's position is:

1. **Liability accepted in principle:** BEU accepts that Sub-Clause 2.1 was not fully performed and that SPCC is entitled in principle to relief.

2. **Impacts likely minimal:** BEU's assessment is that actual impacts are likely to be minimal due to temporary access provision, imminent permanent access, and adequate site area for early works.

3. **EOT entitlement unlikely:** BEU does not believe SPCC will be able to demonstrate delay to the Time for Completion.

4. **Limited additional costs:** BEU accepts that some additional costs may have been incurred, but these are likely to be modest (estimated EUR 5,000-15,000 range) and will require proper substantiation.

5. **Collaborative resolution preferred:** BEU strongly prefers to resolve this matter through collaborative negotiation rather than formal dispute procedures.

6. **Good faith approach:** BEU has acted in good faith to mitigate impacts (temporary access) and resolve the underlying issue (easement negotiations), and expects SPCC to engage constructively in reaching a fair resolution.

---

## REQUESTED ACTIONS

BEU requests that SPCC:

1. Participate in the joint impact assessment meeting on 22 February 2019.

2. Provide detailed claim substantiation by 15 March 2019, focusing on actual demonstrated impacts rather than theoretical maximum impacts.

3. Engage in good faith negotiations to reach amicable resolution.

4. Continue to take all reasonable mitigation measures to minimize impacts.
