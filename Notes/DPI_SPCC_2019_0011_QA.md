**Subject: GT1 Foundation Slab – Concrete Strength Investigation – Engineer's Requirements**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; SPCC/DPI/2019/0006-QA dated 28 September 2019**

Dear Mr. Malý,

I refer to your letter of 28 September 2019 notifying the Engineer of the failed cube test result from the GT1 foundation slab and the investigation underway.

**1. Acknowledgement**

The Engineer acknowledges the Contractor's notification and notes that:

(a) One cube sample (FDN-GT1-005) has failed the 28-day compressive strength test (36 MPa vs 40 MPa specified);

(b) The failed sample was taken from the western area of the GT1 foundation slab;

(c) Core testing is underway to determine actual in-situ strength;

(d) Results are expected on 7 October (accelerated) and 28 October (standard).

**2. Engineer's Concerns**

The Engineer has significant concerns regarding this matter:

(a) **Critical Element:** The GT1 foundation slab is a critical structural element supporting the gas turbine unit. Any deficiency in concrete strength could affect the integrity of the Works.

(b) **Single Failure Significance:** While five of six cubes passed, a 10% failure rate is significant. The spatial pattern (decreasing strength towards the later-poured areas) suggests systematic issues during the pour.

(c) **Timing:** The 28-day results were available on 25 September but were not notified to the Engineer until 28 September. Earlier notification would have been appropriate.

**3. Engineer's Requirements**

Pursuant to Sub-Clauses 4.1 and 7.5, the Engineer requires the following:

**3.1 Investigation Report**

The Contractor shall provide a comprehensive investigation report by **10 October 2019** including:

(a) Full analysis of all cube test results;
(b) Review of pour records, including batch tickets, slump tests, and temperature records;
(c) Core test results (accelerated);
(d) Root cause analysis;
(e) Structural assessment for various strength scenarios;
(f) Recommended course of action.

**3.2 Non-Conformance Report**

If core test results confirm that the in-situ concrete strength is below the specified characteristic strength, the Contractor shall issue a formal Non-Conformance Report (NCR) in accordance with the Quality Management Plan.

**3.3 Remediation Proposal**

If remediation is required, the Contractor shall submit a remediation proposal including:

(a) Proposed remediation method with technical justification;
(b) Design calculations demonstrating adequacy of remediated foundation;
(c) Quality control measures for remediation works;
(d) Programme for remediation;
(e) Impact on GT1 installation schedule.

**3.4 Witness Points**

The Engineer requires witness points for:

(a) Core testing (accelerated and standard);
(b) Any remediation works.

Please provide 48 hours notice for all witness points.

**4. GT1 Installation**

4.1 Until this matter is resolved, the Engineer will not approve GT1 installation on the affected foundation.

4.2 GT1 delivery to site may proceed as scheduled, but installation must await confirmation that the foundation is fit for purpose.

4.3 The Contractor should assess the programme implications of potential remediation scenarios.

**5. Contractual Position**

5.1 The Engineer reserves its position on the contractual consequences of this matter pending completion of the investigation.

5.2 If the defect is confirmed and is attributable to the Contractor's workmanship, materials, or methods, the Contractor shall bear all costs of investigation and remediation in accordance with Sub-Clause 7.5.

5.3 Any delay to the Works resulting from this matter may have consequences under Sub-Clause 8.7 (Delay Damages) if attributable to the Contractor.

**6. Response**

Please confirm receipt of this letter and your acceptance of the above requirements by return.

The Engineer will attend the site on 7 October to review the core test results and discuss next steps.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Heinrich Weber**
