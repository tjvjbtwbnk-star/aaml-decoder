Dear Mr. Procházka,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

We refer to your Variation Request dated 17 May 2019 for contaminated soil disposal works arising from the unforeseeable ground conditions encountered in the GT1 Turbine Hall area.

The Variation has been evaluated by the Engineer and the Employer hereby approves the Variation as set out below.

**2. VARIATION DESCRIPTION**

The Variation comprises the remediation works undertaken by the Contractor in the GT1 area, including:

- Specialist subcontractor (EnviroClean Ltd) mobilisation and works
- Excavation and disposal of contaminated soil (5,620 m³ / 8,430 tonnes)
- Groundwater dewatering and treatment
- Verification sampling and testing
- Backfilling with certified clean material
- Groundwater monitoring
- SPCC supervision and coordination

**3. APPROVED VARIATION VALUE**

The Employer approves Variation Order VO-002 in the amount of:

**EUR 1,850,000** (One Million Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Euros)

This amount is in accordance with the Engineer's recommendation and exceeds the Contractor's original claim of EUR 1,765,000 due to actual quantities being higher than estimated.

**4. CONTRACT PRICE ADJUSTMENT**

The Contract Price is hereby adjusted as follows:

| VO-001 - Additional Ground Investigation | (included above) |

**5. EXTENSION OF TIME**

5.2 No Extension of Time is granted in connection with VO-002 at this time.

5.3 The Contractor's Extension of Time claim for the ground conditions event (DE-002), which we understand will encompass both the remediation delay and the foundation redesign impact, will be evaluated separately upon receipt.

**6. PAYMENT**

The approved Variation amount will be included in the next Interim Payment Certificate following receipt of the Contractor's application.

**7. GROUNDWATER MONITORING**

7.1 We note that the approved amount includes provision for 6 months of groundwater monitoring.

7.2 The Contractor shall provide monthly monitoring reports to the Employer and Engineer.

7.3 If monitoring results indicate any concerns, the Contractor shall notify the Employer immediately.

**8. DOCUMENTATION**

Please ensure that all supporting documentation is retained, including:
- EnviroClean invoices and records
- Disposal manifests and certificates
- Backfill material certificates
- Verification sampling results
- Groundwater monitoring records

**9. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**

The Employer acknowledges the efficient execution of the remediation works by the Contractor and the specialist subcontractor. The completion ahead of programme is noted and appreciated.

Please confirm your acceptance of this Variation Order within 7 days of this letter.

Yours sincerely,
