Dear Ms. Petrović,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – SUBMISSION OF PRELIMINARY PROGRAMME

Further to the Project Management Meeting No. 1 held on 21 January 2019, and in accordance with Sub-Clause 8.3 of the Contract, I am pleased to submit the Preliminary Programme for the Works.

**Enclosed Documents:**
1. Preliminary Programme (Drawing No. SPCC-PROG-001, Rev P01)
2. Programme Narrative and Basis Document

**Programme Overview:**

The Preliminary Programme sets out the planned sequence and timing of the major activities required to complete the Works within the Time for Completion of 1,460 days from the Commencement Date (15 January 2019).

**Key Milestone Dates:**

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Site Possession | 1 February 2019 |
| Basic Design Approval | 15 April 2019 |
| Commencement of Piling Works | 1 May 2019 |
| Main Foundation Completion | 1 September 2019 |
| GT1 Delivery to Site | 1 March 2020 |
| GT2 Delivery to Site | 1 May 2020 |
| HRSG1 Installation Complete | 1 October 2020 |
| HRSG2 Installation Complete | 1 December 2020 |
| Steam Turbine Installation Complete | 1 March 2021 |
| Mechanical Completion | 15 July 2022 |
| First Fire GT1 | 1 September 2022 |
| Performance Tests | 1 November 2022 |
| Taking Over | 14 January 2023 |

**Programme Basis:**

The Preliminary Programme has been developed based on the following key assumptions:

1. Site possession on 1 February 2019 with no access restrictions
2. Timely approval of design submissions within 21 days as per Contract
3. Availability of long-lead equipment as per confirmed delivery schedules from suppliers
4. No unforeseeable ground conditions requiring remedial works
5. Normal weather conditions for the region (allowances included for winter working)
6. Availability of adequate skilled labor resources in Borduria and surrounding region
7. Timely provision of Employer's design data and approval of Contractor's submissions

**Critical Path:**

The current critical path runs through the following key activities:
- Design development and approval (Feb-Apr 2019)
- Foundation works (Apr-Sep 2019)
- Gas turbine procurement and delivery (current - May 2020)
- GT and HRSG installation (Jun 2020 - Dec 2020)
- Commissioning and performance testing (Jul 2022 - Jan 2023)

**Work Breakdown and Resources:**

The programme shows the Works broken down into the following main areas:
- Engineering and Design
- Site Mobilisation and Preliminaries
- Civil and Structural Works
- Mechanical Installation
- Electrical and I&C Installation
- Commissioning and Testing

Resource histograms are included showing planned labor deployment peaking at approximately 450 personnel during the main mechanical erection phase.

**Interface Management:**

The programme reflects interfaces with the following items not in SPCC's scope:
- Natural gas pipeline connection (scheduled completion: June 2022)
- 400 kV transmission line to Szohôd North (scheduled completion: August 2022)

SPCC has allowed reasonable float for these interfaces, but close coordination will be required to ensure no delays to the Project.

**Programme Development:**

As agreed at PMM-001, SPCC will submit a detailed Baseline Programme (Rev 0) by 28 February 2019. This will include:
- Greater level of detail (breakdown to 2-3 week activity level)
- Logic links and critical path analysis
- Resource loading by discipline
- Material delivery schedule integrated with construction activities
- Weather contingencies by season
- Detailed commissioning and testing procedures

Please note that this Preliminary Programme is provided for early alignment on the general execution strategy and key dates. The Baseline Programme (Rev 0) will serve as the formal programme for progress monitoring and will be subject to the Engineer's review and approval as per Sub-Clause 8.3.

Should you require any clarification or wish to discuss any aspect of the Preliminary Programme, please do not hesitate to contact our Planning Manager, Mr. Martin Dvořák, or myself.

Yours sincerely,

**Miroslav Horák**  
Project Manager  
Syldavian Power Construction Consortium
