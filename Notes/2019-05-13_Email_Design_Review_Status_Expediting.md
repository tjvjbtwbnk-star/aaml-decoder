**Subject:** Design Review Status - Expediting Request
---

Dear Tomáš,

I am writing regarding the overall design review status and the establishment of the design review task force discussed at PMM-004 and subsequently proposed by Miroslav in his email of 6 May.

**CURRENT STATUS:**

The Engineer's design review is progressing, but I share the concern expressed by all parties that the Basic Design approval timeline has extended significantly beyond the contractual milestone. Current status:

| Batch | Status | Target Approval |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Batch 1 | Approved | Complete |
| Batch 2 Rev A | Comments issued 3 May; awaiting SPCC response | 20 May |
| Batch 3 | Under review; comments to be issued 15 May | 31 May |
| Batch 4 | Under review; comments to be issued 20 May | 7 June |
| GT1 Foundation | Awaiting submission | TBD |

**FORECAST BASIC DESIGN APPROVAL: 12 JUNE 2019**

This represents a delay of approximately 58 days from the contractual milestone of 15 April 2019.

**ANALYSIS:**

Having reviewed the design review process, I offer the following observations:

1. **Initial Submission Quality:** The Batch 1 and 2 initial submissions contained a higher number of comments than typical for a project of this nature. This contributed to extended review cycles.

2. **Review Duration:** DPI has endeavoured to complete reviews within contractual timeframes. In some instances, reviews have taken longer due to the volume and complexity of comments requiring evaluation.

3. **Ground Conditions:** The discovery of contaminated soil and the artesian aquifer has impacted the civil/structural design package significantly. This was unforeseen by all parties.

4. **Resource Constraints:** Both SPCC and DPI have been operating with design resources planned for a more straightforward review process.

**RESPONSIBILITY:**

In my assessment, the design approval delay is a mixed-responsibility matter:

- Contractor factors: Initial submission quality, response turnaround times
- Employer/Engineer factors: Review complexity, some extended review periods
- Neutral factors: Ground conditions discovery (Employer risk under Contract, but affecting both parties' workload)

A precise apportionment would require detailed analysis, which may be necessary if this becomes a formal dispute. For now, I encourage both parties to focus on achieving approval rather than attributing blame.

**DESIGN TASK FORCE:**

I am supportive of the design task force proposal. To be effective, I suggest:

1. **Frequency:** Twice weekly (Tuesdays and Fridays) until Basic Design approval complete
2. **Participants:** SPCC (Dr. Braun + discipline leads), BEU (Mr. Kostić), DPI (Ms. Kowalska + reviewer as required)
3. **Format:** Video conference acceptable; in-person at Site or Klow as practical
4. **Objective:** Real-time resolution of comments; identify and address issues before formal correspondence

I have asked Emilia Kowalska to coordinate the first meeting for tomorrow (Tuesday, 14 May) at 10:00. A calendar invitation will follow.

**EXPEDITING REQUEST:**

To meet the 12 June target for Basic Design approval, the following responses are required from SPCC:

| Item | Required By |
|------|-------------|
| Batch 2 Rev B (response to 3 May comments) | 15 May 2019 |
| Batch 3 comment responses | 24 May 2019 |
| Batch 4 comment responses | 31 May 2019 |
| GT1 Foundation preliminary submission | 17 May 2019 |
| GT1 Foundation final submission | 31 May 2019 |

DPI commits to providing expedited reviews (within 5 working days) for all resubmissions, subject to submission quality.

**PARTIAL APPROVALS:**

To support construction progress, I confirm the following partial approvals are in effect:

- Batch 1: Approved - detailed design may proceed
- Batch 2 (partial): Admin Building, HRSG, and Cooling Tower foundations - piling may proceed
- Batch 2 (partial): Site grading and drainage - earthworks may proceed

These partial approvals allow construction to continue while design reviews are completed.

I trust this provides clarity on the current situation and the path forward. I remain committed to working collaboratively with all parties to achieve design approval at the earliest opportunity.

Best regards,
