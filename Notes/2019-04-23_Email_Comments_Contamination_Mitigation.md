Dear Wilhelm,

Following the EPA inspection last Thursday (which went smoothly - formal approval of the remediation approach expected this week) and our internal review, I wanted to share some preliminary comments on the contamination mitigation approach before we finalise the specification.

**General:**

BEU supports the recommendation for Option A (Excavation and Off-Site Disposal) as presented in TR-004. This provides the most certain outcome and avoids any long-term monitoring obligations that could complicate plant operations.

**Specific Comments:**

1. **Excavation Limits:**
   
   We agree with defining the contaminated zone by the 1,000 mg/kg TPH contour plus 2m buffer as discussed at TCM-001. However, we would like to see verification sampling at the excavation base before backfilling to confirm that all contaminated material has been removed. Please include this in your methodology.

2. **Groundwater Management:**
   
   The artesian aquifer will produce significant groundwater inflow during excavation. Your TR-004 references "groundwater treatment" but does not provide detail. We need a specific proposal for:
   - Dewatering system design and capacity
   - Treatment method (oil/water separation, carbon filtration, etc.)
   - Discharge location and permit requirements
   - Monitoring protocol
   
   Please note that discharge to the municipal storm drain will require a temporary discharge permit from Szohôd Water Authority. BEU can assist with this application but we need the technical parameters from SPCC.

3. **Backfill Material:**
   
   The specification should confirm that backfill material will be certified clean engineered fill meeting the structural requirements for the GT1 foundation. Please provide a backfill specification for our review.

4. **Air Monitoring:**
   
   Given the benzene levels detected (up to 1.2 mg/kg in soil), we require continuous air monitoring during excavation works. Please confirm what monitoring equipment will be deployed and the action levels that will trigger work stoppage.

5. **Disposal Documentation:**
   
   We will require full chain of custody documentation for all contaminated material removed from site, including weighbridge tickets, waste transfer notes, and confirmation of receipt at the Szohôd facility.

**Programme:**

I understand you are targeting commencement of remediation works in mid-May, subject to EPA approval and BEU specification. This seems achievable if we can finalise the methodology this week.

Can you provide an updated remediation programme showing the critical path activities? We need to understand the interface with the GT1 foundation redesign work.

**Cost:**

Regarding the cost estimate in TR-004 (EUR 985,000), we have obtained independent quotations from Szohôd Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility:

- Disposal rate: EUR 85/tonne (versus your assumed EUR 100/tonne)
- Estimated tonnage: 7,650 tonnes (at 1.5 t/m³ density for 5,100 m³)
- Disposal cost: EUR 650,250 (versus your EUR 510,000)

There appears to be a discrepancy in the volume/tonnage calculation. Can you please clarify? We want to ensure we are working from agreed quantities.

**Next Steps:**

I propose we schedule a brief call on Thursday (25 April) to discuss these points before I issue the formal specification. Would 14:00 work for you?

Best regards,
