### 4. GT1 Foundation Concrete Investigation

O. Malý presented the status of the GT1 foundation concrete investigation:

**Issue:**
- One cube test (FDN-GT1-005) failed 28-day strength: 36 MPa vs 40 MPa required
- Located in western area of GT1 foundation slab

**Investigation Status:**
- Core drilling completed (6 cores)
- Accelerated testing in progress
- Results expected 7 October

**Preliminary Assessment:**
- Localised issue – likely due to extended pour duration
- 5 of 6 cubes passed with good margin
- Structural assessment prepared for various scenarios

M. Todorović (BEU) asked why this issue was not identified earlier. O. Malý explained that 28-day results were received on 25 September and the investigation commenced immediately.

Dr. Vladić expressed serious concern. The GT1 foundation is critical infrastructure and any defect is unacceptable. He requested:
1. Full investigation report by 10 October
2. Root cause analysis regardless of core results
3. NCR to be issued if cores confirm non-compliance

M. Horák confirmed these would be provided.

Dr. Weber (DPI) stated that the Engineer will review the investigation findings and make a determination on acceptability.
