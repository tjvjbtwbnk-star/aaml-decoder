**Subject: Claim for Extension of Time and Additional Costs - Unforeseeable Ground Conditions (DE-002)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clauses 4.12, 8.4, and 20.1**

Dear Ms. Nikolić,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

In accordance with Sub-Clauses 4.12 and 20.1 of the Conditions of Contract, and further to our notices dated 28 March 2019, 9 April 2019, and 10 May 2019, we hereby submit our fully substantiated claim for Extension of Time and additional costs arising from the unforeseeable ground conditions encountered in the GT1 Turbine Hall area.

This claim addresses the time and cost impacts of the ground conditions event. The direct remediation costs (VO-001 and VO-002) have been addressed separately and are excluded from this claim.

**2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Event:** | Discovery of contaminated soil and perched artesian aquifer |
| **Location:** | GT1 Turbine Hall area (NE sector of Site) |
| **Discovery Date:** | 22 March 2019 |
| **Notification:** | 28 March 2019 (Sub-Clause 4.12 notice) |
| **EOT Claimed:** | 68 calendar days |
| **Costs Claimed:** | EUR 2,950,000 |

**3. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

3.1 **Original Design Basis:**

The original GT1 foundation design was based on the geotechnical information in the Employer's Requirements, which indicated:
- Suitable founding conditions in medium dense sand at 8-10m depth
- No contamination
- Groundwater at approximately 12m depth

3.2 **Conditions Encountered:**

During ground investigation in March 2019, the following conditions were discovered:

| Parameter | Expected | Actual |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Contamination | None | TPH 1,940-4,120 mg/kg |
| Contaminated zone | N/A | 3,200 m² area, 3.5-6.2m depth |
| Artesian aquifer | None | Present at 5-6m to 12m depth |
| Suitable founding | 8-10m depth | 30-35m depth |

3.3 **Consequences:**

The unforeseeable conditions required:
- Contaminated soil remediation (6 weeks)
- GT1 foundation redesign (deep bored piles instead of driven piles)
- Extended piling duration (4 weeks instead of 2.5 weeks)
- Additional pile cap construction time

**4. CONTRACT PROVISIONS**

4.1 **Sub-Clause 4.12 (Unforeseeable Physical Conditions):**

The contaminated soil and artesian aquifer constitute physical conditions which were not foreseeable by an experienced contractor. The conditions were:
- Not indicated in the Site Data
- Not discoverable from a reasonable visual inspection
- More adverse than could reasonably have been anticipated

4.2 **Sub-Clause 8.4 (Extension of Time for Completion):**

The Contractor is entitled to an extension of time if completion is or will be delayed by a cause listed in Sub-Clause 8.4, including unforeseeable physical conditions under Sub-Clause 4.12.

4.3 **Sub-Clause 20.1 (Contractor's Claims):**

Notice was given within 28 days of becoming aware of the conditions. This fully substantiated claim is submitted within the reasonable time required for preparation.

**5. TIME IMPACT ANALYSIS**

**5.1 Methodology:**

A time impact analysis has been prepared using the "impacted as-planned" method, comparing the as-planned programme with the impacted programme.

**5.2 Delay Components:**

| Component | Duration (days) | Critical Path Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Remediation works | 42 | 42 days |
| Additional investigation delay | 8 | 0 days (concurrent) |
| Foundation redesign | 15 | 0 days (concurrent) |
| Extended piling duration | 10 | 10 days |
| Extended pile cap construction | 8 | 8 days |
| Disruption to other works | 8 | 8 days |
| **Total Delay** | | **68 days** |

**5.3 Critical Path Analysis:**

The GT1 foundation is on the critical path for GT1 installation. The delay components identified directly affect:
- GT1 foundation completion: +68 days
- GT1 erection start: +68 days
- GT1 commissioning: +68 days
- Taking Over: +68 days (unless mitigated)

**5.4 Mitigation:**

The Contractor has implemented the following mitigation measures:
- Expedited remediation (completed 4 days early)
- Parallel working where possible
- Extended hours for foundation works

These measures have reduced the gross delay but cannot eliminate the impact entirely.

**6. EXTENSION OF TIME CLAIMED**

Based on the time impact analysis, the Contractor claims an Extension of Time of:

**68 calendar days**

This would adjust the Time for Completion from 14 January 2023 to 23 March 2023.

**7. COST CLAIM**

**7.1 Costs Excluded:**

The following costs have been addressed separately and are excluded:
- VO-001 (Additional Ground Investigation): EUR 245,000 - Approved
- VO-002 (Contaminated Soil Disposal): EUR 1,850,000 - Approved

**7.2 Costs Claimed:**

| | Extended dewatering | 145,000 |
| | Additional pile cap concrete and rebar | 195,000 |
