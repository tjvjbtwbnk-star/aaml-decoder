### 1. Review of Previous Minutes and Actions

The minutes of WPM-023 dated 7 August 2019 were approved without amendment.

**Action Review:**

| Action | Description | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| WPM-023/01 | Formal technical report on HRSG ground conditions | A. Kováč | Open – due this week |
| WPM-023/02 | Comments on Recovery Programme | BEU | Closed – issued 12 Aug |
| WPM-023/03 | Submit VO-004 request (additional piling) | J. Procházka | Closed – submitted 8 Aug |
| WPM-020/01 | Weekly heat stress summary to BEU | P. Horváth | Ongoing |

### 2. Safety Report

P. Horváth reported:

- No lost time incidents during the week
- Total man-hours worked: 16,200 (continued high level)
- Near-misses: Two incidents reported:
  1. Unsecured scaffold board fell 3m (no injuries) – scaffold inspection enhanced
  2. Reversing concrete truck near-contact with worker – banksman procedures reviewed
- Heat stress: Temperatures moderating (28-32°C), fewer heat-related issues
- Night operations: Continuing for GT1 and now also HRSG piling

I. Petrović (BEU) expressed concern about the scaffold incident and requested a copy of the incident investigation report.

**Action:** P. Horváth to provide scaffold incident investigation to BEU.

### 3. Construction Progress – Recovery Programme Status

P. Novotný presented construction progress:

**3.1 GT1 Pile Cap**
- Pour 2: Complete (7 August) – cube tests satisfactory
- Pour 3: Formwork 85% complete, rebar 60% installed
- Pour 3 scheduled: 16 August (on track)
- Foundation slab: Scheduled 22 August (revised from 19 August due to Pour 3 slip)

T. Polák explained that Pour 3 formwork took longer than planned due to complexity of the edge shuttering. The team is working extended hours to recover.

**3.2 HRSG Area**
- Pours 1-7: Complete (58%)
- Pours 8-10: On hold pending additional piling
- Pour 11: Preparation in progress (on track)
- Pour 12: Excavation complete
- Additional piling: First pile (HP-01) completed 13 August, second pile (HP-02) in progress

A. Kováč reported that the additional piling is progressing well. The borehole confirmed the founding stratum at 11.8m, consistent with the investigation results. All 6 piles expected complete by 21 August.

**3.3 Cooling Tower**
- Pour 7: Complete (9 August)
- Pour 8: Scheduled today (14 August) – inspection passed this morning
- Overall: 88% complete (7 of 8 pours)

**3.4 Summary Status**

| Area | Last Week | This Week | Change |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| GT1 Foundation | 35% | 55% | +20% |
| HRSG | 58% | 62% | +4% |
| Cooling Tower | 75% | 88% | +13% |

### 4. HRSG Additional Piling Update

A. Kováč provided a detailed update on the additional piling:

**Progress:**
| Pile | Diameter | Depth | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| HP-01 | 600mm | 11.8m | Complete 13 Aug |
| HP-02 | 600mm | - | Drilling in progress |
| HP-03 to HP-06 | 600mm | - | Scheduled 15-21 Aug |

**Observations:**
- Founding stratum (dense sand) encountered at depths of 11.2-11.8m – consistent with investigation
- No further surprises to date
- Concrete strength achieving 45 MPa (target 40 MPa)

I. Petrović (BEU) confirmed that the provisional instruction to proceed with piling was issued on 9 August. VO-004 evaluation is in progress.

### 5. Programme Update

M. Dvořák presented the programme status:

**Recovery Programme Status:**

| Measure | Planned Days | Achieved | Status |
|---------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Night shift (GT1) | 3 | 3 | Complete |
| Three-pour pile cap | 2 | 1* | Partially achieved |
| High-early concrete | 2 | 2 | On track |
| HRSG parallel sequence | 4 | 3 | On track |
| Weekend working | 3 | 2 | Partially achieved |

*One day lost due to Pour 3 formwork delay

**Revised Forecast:**

| Milestone | Recovery Rev 0 | Current Forecast | Change |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| GT1 Foundation | 28 Aug | 30 Aug | +2 days |
| HRSG Complete | 6 Sep | 7 Sep | +1 day |
| CT Complete | 30 Aug | 30 Aug | 0 |
| **Foundation Completion** | **6 Sep** | **7 Sep** | **+1 day** |

I. Petrović (BEU) noted with concern that the forecast has slipped by a further day since the Recovery Programme submission. She requested an explanation.

M. Dvořák explained that the GT1 Pour 3 formwork delay and slightly lower BCC productivity than assumed have contributed to the slip. Recovery measures are being enhanced.

### 6. Design Progress

Dr. Braun reported:

- Detailed Design overall: 42% complete (was 38%)
- Response to DPI structural comments submitted 12 August
- Cooling system detailed design: 15% (accelerating following VO-003 agreement)
- Grid connection data: Still outstanding – affecting electrical design

D. Kostić (BEU) stated that BEU has escalated the grid data request to the TSO management level. A response is expected by end of this week.

Dr. Braun noted that if the data is not received by 22 August, a formal notice under Sub-Clause 1.9 will be issued.

### 7. Commercial Matters

J. Procházka reported:

**7.1 VO-003 (Cooling System)**
- Variation Order signed 9 August
- Amount: EUR 19,750,000
- EOT: 55 days
- Revised Completion Date: 10 March 2023

**7.2 VO-004 (Additional Piling)**
- Request submitted 8 August
- Works proceeding under provisional instruction
- BEU/DPI evaluation in progress

**7.3 DE-002 (Ground Conditions)**
- SPCC response to Engineer's determination submitted 14 August
- Seeking reconsideration of EOT (35 days vs 68 days claimed)

**7.4 Payment Status**
- IPC No. 7 certified 12 August: EUR 40,250,000 (reduced from EUR 42M submitted due to retention adjustment)
- IPC No. 8 in preparation

K. Hoffmann (DPI) confirmed the IPC No. 7 certification.

### 8. Quality Update

O. Malý reported:

- No NCRs raised during the week
- GT1 Pile Cap Pour 2: 7-day cube strength 46 MPa (excellent)
- HRSG additional pile HP-01: Cube tests compliant
- Formwork inspection issues from previous week: All addressed

M. Todorović (BEU) requested that SPCC implement a formal pre-pour checklist sign-off process to ensure all items are verified before pour clearance.

O. Malý agreed this would be beneficial and will implement from the next pour.

**Action:** O. Malý to implement formal pre-pour checklist sign-off process.

### 9. BCC Resource Discussion

I. Petrović raised the BCC resource issue based on B. Simić's observations:

**Issue:** BCC workforce observed at 97 personnel on Monday versus 125 committed in the Recovery Programme.

P. Novotný acknowledged the shortfall and explained:
- Some workers on rest days following weekend work
- Recruitment of additional workers ongoing but competitive labour market
- BCC has committed to achieving 115 personnel by next Monday (19 August)

I. Petrović stated that this is unacceptable. The Recovery Programme commits to specific resource levels and BCC must deliver. She requested that:
1. SPCC formally write to BCC requiring compliance
2. Daily headcount reports be provided to BEU
3. If resources not achieved by 19 August, BEU will consider this evidence of inadequate progress under Sub-Clause 8.6

M. Horák acknowledged the concern and confirmed SPCC will take appropriate action with BCC.

**Action:** P. Novotný to write to BCC requiring compliance with resource commitments.
**Action:** T. Polák to provide daily headcount reports to BEU.

### 10. Any Other Business

**10.1 Grid Connection Data**
Dr. Braun reiterated the urgency of the grid data. Detailed electrical design is now 3 weeks behind where it should be due to this issue.

**10.2 Structural Steel Delivery**
First structural steel delivery (Admin Building) confirmed for 19 August. Erection to commence 26 August.

**10.3 Recovery Programme Rev 1**
M. Dvořák confirmed the revised Recovery Programme will be submitted by 19 August addressing BEU's comments.
