# EMAIL

**From:** Pavel Novotný <p.novotny@spcc-jv.com>  
**To:** Branko Simić <b.simic@beu.bd>  
**Cc:** Miroslav Horák <m.horak@spcc-jv.com>; Ivana Petrović <i.petrovic@beu.bd>  
**Date:** 25 January 2019, 11:20  
**Subject:** Site establishment requirements and access

Dear Branko,

I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the site possession date of 1 February, I wanted to outline our immediate site establishment requirements and confirm the access arrangements.

**Phase 1 Mobilisation (Week of 4-8 February):**

1. **Site Access and Security**
   - Need to confirm location of main gate and access controls
   - Will SPCC be responsible for site security from day one, or will BEU maintain security during initial period?
   - We plan to install our own security gate and fence system, but need temporary arrangements until this is complete

2. **Temporary Facilities**
   - Site offices: We will bring in modular office units (approximately 400m²)
   - Proposed location: Northeast corner of site near main access road
   - Installation will take approximately 5 days
   - Welfare facilities: Changing rooms, toilets, canteen for up to 50 people initially

3. **Laydown and Storage Areas**
   - Need to confirm designated areas for materials storage
   - Requirements: Approximately 5,000m² hard standing initially
   - Some areas will need compacted stone sub-base - can this be arranged in advance?
   - Secure compound for valuable equipment and tools

4. **Utilities - Temporary Connections**
   - **Power:** You mentioned temporary connection points at the eastern boundary. Could you confirm:
     - Available capacity (we estimate 150 kVA initially, increasing to 500 kVA by March)
     - Voltage and phase configuration
     - Need to install our own transformer or connection arrangements?
   
   - **Water:** 
     - Temporary connection point location?
     - Available pressure and flow rate?
     - Quality sufficient for welfare facilities and dust suppression?
   
   - **Communications:**
     - Any existing telephone lines or internet connectivity at site?
     - We will install satellite internet if needed, but local connection would be preferable

5. **Site Surveys and Investigations**
   - Our survey team will mobilize week of 4 February to establish site control network
   - Will need access to any existing survey benchmarks or control points
   - Ground investigation drilling rig will arrive approximately 18 February (separate coordination required)

**Immediate Actions Required:**

Before 1 February, could you please provide:
1. Site boundary survey and coordinates of property corners
2. Locations of temporary utility connection points with technical specifications
3. Confirmation of any site restrictions or "no-go" areas
4. Contact details for utility providers if we need to coordinate directly
5. Requirements for site access passes and vehicle permits

**Site Handover Meeting:**

I propose we conduct a formal site handover meeting on **1 February at 10:00** at the site main gate. Attendees from SPCC side will include:
- Pavel Novotný (myself)
- Tomáš Polák (Civil Works Superintendent - arriving 30 January)
- Survey team leader
- HSE representative

Could you confirm this time works for you and who will attend from BEU side?

**Pre-mobilisation Site Visit:**

Would it be possible for me and Tomáš Polák to visit the site on **30 January (Wednesday)** for a preliminary walk-through? This would help us finalize our mobilisation logistics. We could meet you there mid-morning if that's convenient.

I realize this is quite a detailed list, but getting these basics right in the first week will really help us establish efficiently and safely. Please let me know if you need any clarification on our requirements.

Looking forward to working with you closely over the coming months.

Best regards,

**Pavel Novotný**
