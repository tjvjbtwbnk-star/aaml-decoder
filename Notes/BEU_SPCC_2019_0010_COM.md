**Subject: Response to Resubmission of EOT Claim - Delayed Site Access (DE-001)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Your Ref: SPCC/BEU/2019/0013-COM dated 30 April 2019**

Dear Mr. Procházka,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

We refer to your resubmission of the Extension of Time claim for delayed Site access (DE-001) dated 30 April 2019, and the meeting held on 10 May 2019 between our respective commercial teams.

The Employer has carefully reviewed the additional evidence and analysis provided in your resubmission, and has reconsidered its position.

**2. EMPLOYER'S REVISED ASSESSMENT**

2.1 The Employer acknowledges the following points raised in your resubmission:

(a) **Boreholes Affected:** We accept that 8 boreholes (BH-17 to BH-24), not 2 as stated in our original response, were affected by the access restriction. The BGS confirmation letter and borehole access plan provide adequate evidence of this.

(b) **Drilling Remobilisation:** We accept that BGS demobilised and subsequently remobilised to complete the NE area investigation, incurring additional time and cost.

(c) **Mitigation Measures:** We acknowledge the mitigation measures implemented by the Contractor, including re-sequencing of works and advancement of activities in accessible areas.

2.2 However, the Employer maintains that:

(a) The Time Impact Analysis provided does not fully demonstrate a critical path impact of 45 days;

(b) The NE area works remain substantially non-critical activities;

(c) The claimed knock-on effect to foundation design approval is partially attributable to other factors, including the quality of design submissions.

**3. ENGINEER'S ASSESSMENT**

3.1 At the meeting on 10 May 2019, the Engineer (represented by Mr. Karl Hoffmann) provided a preliminary assessment indicating that an Extension of Time in the range of 15-25 days may be supportable based on the evidence presented.

3.2 The Engineer noted that a precise determination would require detailed analysis of the programme logic and concurrent delay factors.

**4. EMPLOYER'S OFFER**

4.1 In the interest of resolving this matter amicably and avoiding the cost and time of a formal determination process, the Employer offers to accept an Extension of Time of **20 calendar days** in respect of DE-001.

4.2 This offer is made on the following basis:

(a) The 20 days represents a fair and reasonable assessment of the actual critical path impact of the delayed Site access;

(b) The offer accounts for the Contractor's mitigation efforts;

(c) The offer reflects the mixed nature of the delay factors affecting design approval (some Contractor responsibility, some Employer responsibility).

4.3 This offer is made without admission of liability for the full 45 days claimed and is subject to acceptance by the Contractor within 14 days of this letter.

**5. COST CLAIM**

5.1 We note your indication of a forthcoming cost claim in the range of EUR 180,000 - 220,000.

5.2 If the Extension of Time is agreed at 20 days, the Employer would be prepared to consider a proportionate cost claim. We would expect the cost claim to be substantiated with detailed records and to reflect the reduced EOT.

5.3 We reserve our position on costs pending receipt and review of the detailed claim.

**6. CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE**

6.1 If the Contractor accepts the offer of 20 days EOT, the Employer requests confirmation in writing within 14 days (i.e., by 28 May 2019).

6.2 Upon acceptance, the Employer will instruct the Engineer to issue a formal Extension of Time determination.

6.3 If the Contractor does not accept this offer, the matter will be referred to the Engineer for determination under Sub-Clause 3.5.

**7. WITHOUT PREJUDICE**

7.1 This offer is made on a without prejudice basis.

7.2 If the matter proceeds to formal determination, the Employer reserves the right to maintain its original position that no Extension of Time is due, and to present additional analysis in support of that position.

We trust this demonstrates the Employer's willingness to resolve this matter pragmatically and look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,

**Ana Nikolić**
