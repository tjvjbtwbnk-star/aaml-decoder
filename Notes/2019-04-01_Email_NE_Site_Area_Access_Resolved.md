Dear Miroslav,

I am pleased to inform you that the easement matter with Klow Chemical Works regarding the 2.1 hectare area in the north-eastern corner of the Site has been resolved.

As you are aware, this issue has been ongoing since Site possession was granted on 1 February 2019. Our legal team, working closely with the Municipal Land Registry and representatives of Klow Chemical Works, has successfully concluded negotiations. The boundary easement agreement was formally registered this morning.

We will be issuing formal written notice under the Contract separately today (reference to follow), but I wanted to provide you with immediate notification so that your team can begin planning accordingly.

Please note the following:

1. Full access to the NE area will be available from tomorrow, 2 April 2019
2. No restrictions apply to the previously excluded zone
3. Branko Simić will coordinate physical access arrangements with your Site team
4. BEU will remove the temporary fencing currently delineating the exclusion zone by close of business today

I acknowledge that this delayed access has impacted your planned works sequence, and we have received your formal notice under Sub-Clause 2.1 dated 18 February 2019. Ana Nikolić will be in contact separately regarding the commercial aspects of this matter.

I trust this resolves the Site access issue to your satisfaction, and we look forward to seeing progress in this area.

Best regards,
