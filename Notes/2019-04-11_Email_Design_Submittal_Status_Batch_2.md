Dear Emilia,

Thank you for the detailed comments on Basic Design Batch 2 issued on 3 April. We have been working through the responses and I wanted to provide you with a status update and discuss the path forward.

**Response Status:**

Of the 52 comments received, we have addressed the following:

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Category A (Major) | 12 | 10 closed, 2 require discussion |
| Category B (Minor) | 28 | 28 closed |
| Category C (Observations) | 12 | 12 closed |

The two outstanding Category A items relate to the GT1 foundation design and, as you may be aware, this area is now subject to the contaminated soil conditions recently discovered. Specifically:

**Comment A-07:** Foundation bearing capacity calculations for GT1 pedestal
**Comment A-11:** Dewatering scheme for GT1 excavation

Both of these will need to be revised in light of the contamination assessment findings (TR-004). We propose to address these comments once the remediation approach is confirmed, as the foundation design solution may need to change depending on the chosen remediation method.

**Proposal:**

We would like to submit Batch 2 Rev A tomorrow (12 April) with responses to 50 of 52 comments, with A-07 and A-11 noted as "held pending ground conditions resolution."

This would allow you to proceed with review of the majority of the civil/structural design package while we work through the GT1 specifics. Once the remediation approach is confirmed (TCM scheduled for tomorrow), we can issue a supplementary submission addressing the GT1 foundation.

Please confirm if this approach is acceptable to DPI.

**Batch 3 & 4:**

We note that comments on Batch 3 (Mechanical) are expected 15 April and Batch 4 (Electrical/I&C) on 18 April. We have resources allocated to respond promptly and would appreciate early notification of any significant issues.

**Basic Design Approval:**

Given the current status, we acknowledge that the 15 April contractual milestone for Basic Design Approval will not be achieved. We are targeting completion of all review cycles by end of May, subject to resolution of the ground conditions matter.

I am available for a call this afternoon if you would like to discuss.

Best regards,
