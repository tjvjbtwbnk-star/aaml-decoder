## 4. GROUND INVESTIGATION PROGRESS

**TP** reported on ground investigation progress:

**Status:**
- Drilling commenced Monday 18 February as planned
- Good progress being made
- BGS crew working efficiently (1 drilling rig operational, 1 support rig for shallow investigations)

**Boreholes Completed (as of morning 20 Feb):**
- BH-01 (GT Hall area): Complete, 30m depth
- BH-02 (GT Hall area): Complete, 30m depth
- BH-03 (HRSG area): In progress, currently at 18m of 25m

**Current Progress:**
- 2.5 boreholes completed in 3 days
- Slightly ahead of schedule
- No unexpected ground conditions encountered to date
- Groundwater observed at approximately 8-10m depth (as expected)

**Schedule:**
- Continuing drilling in main site areas through to 25 Feb
- NE area drilling: 25 Feb - 5 Mar (temporary access period)
- Expected completion: 8 March (2 days earlier than original 15 March forecast)
- Laboratory testing: Progressive, samples being sent daily to BGS lab in Szohôd

**Preliminary Observations:**
- Soil profile appears to be relatively consistent across the site
- Predominantly sandy clay to approximately 12m depth, then gravelly sand layers
- Groundwater table at 8-10m (may vary seasonally)
- No obvious contamination or unusual conditions
- More detailed characterization to follow from lab testing

**BS** asked if any issues accessing the areas for drilling. **TP** confirmed no issues - site access is good and borehole locations are all accessible.

**IP** (joined meeting at 10:30) asked about NE area temporary access logistics. **TP** confirmed coordination meeting scheduled with Branko tomorrow (21 Feb) to finalize arrangements. Insurance certificate has been provided to Branko as required.

**Action: TP and BS to conduct coordination meeting on NE area drilling access (21 Feb).**

## 5. NE AREA ACCESS ISSUE - COMMERCIAL DISCUSSION

**IP** and **JP** joined the meeting at 10:35 for this item.

**IP** provided update on the NE area access matter (see also her email to Miroslav Horák dated 19 Feb):

**Status Update:**
- Easement negotiations progressing well
- Sign-off expected first week of March
- Permanent full access anticipated **mid-March 2019**

**IP** acknowledged SPCC's Sub-Clause 20.1 notice dated 18 Feb and stated BEU will provide formal written response by end of this week.

**IP** proposed a pragmatic approach:
- Joint meeting to discuss actual impacts and mitigation
- Collaborative resolution rather than formal claims process
- Proposed meeting Friday 22 Feb after BEU management site visit

**JP** responded on behalf of SPCC:
- SPCC appreciates BEU's transparent communication and mitigation efforts
- Willing to discuss pragmatic resolution
- SPCC is obliged to preserve contractual rights through formal notice
- Actual impacts will be documented and quantified
- Open to collaborative resolution if fair and reasonable

**Discussion:** Both parties agreed that the temporary access for drilling has largely mitigated the immediate impact, but permanent access is needed by mid-March to avoid affecting subsequent works.

**Agreed Approach:**
- Meeting Friday 22 Feb PM (after BEU management visit) to discuss impacts and potential resolution
- SPCC will provide preliminary impact assessment
- BEU will provide formal response to Sub-Clause 20.1 notice
- Aim for amicable resolution without requiring Engineer's determination

**MS** noted that the Engineer is available to assist if the parties wish, but encourages direct resolution where possible.

**Action: SPCC to provide preliminary impact assessment for NE area access delay (JP/JS - by 22 Feb meeting).**

**Action: BEU to issue formal response to Sub-Clause 20.1 notice (IP/AN - by 22 Feb).**

## 8. PROGRAMME

**JS** provided programme update:

**Current Status:** Generally on schedule, with one area of concern (NE access).

**Milestones This Week:**
- Ground investigation commenced (18 Feb) ✓
- Basic Design Batch 3 submitted (18 Feb) ✓
- Civil works tender issued (18 Feb) ✓
