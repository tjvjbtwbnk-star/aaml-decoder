**From:** Pavel Novotný <p.novotny@spcc-jv.com>  
**To:** Ivana Petrović <i.petrovic@beu.bd>  
**Cc:** Miroslav Horák <m.horak@spcc-jv.com>; Branko Simić <b.simic@beu.bd>  
**Date:** 4 February 2019, 16:30  
**Subject:** Confirmation of site access received

Dear Ivana,

Thank you for your letter ref. BEU/SPCC/2019/0002-GEN dated 1 February 2019 providing formal notice of site possession.

I can confirm that SPCC has received possession of the Site (excluding the northeastern area as noted) and that we conducted a satisfactory handover meeting with Branko on 1 February. The site inspection went well and all the documentation has been completed.

**Site Condition Documentation:**

As advised in your letter, we have conducted a thorough photographic survey of the site condition as received. Our survey team has documented:
- Current topography and surface conditions
- Existing ground cover (mostly sparse grass and low vegetation)
- Two small concrete pads in the western area (remnants of previous structures - noted on drawings)
- Surface drainage patterns (generally good drainage, slight slope east to west)
- Access road conditions

No issues or unusual conditions have been observed. The site is in good condition for commencement of works.

**Temporary Utilities:**

We have confirmed the location of temporary utility connection points and they are acceptable for our needs. Our electrical contractor will connect to the temporary power supply by 7 February. Water connection will be made when our welfare facilities arrive (expected 11 February).

**Mobilisation Progress:**

Our mobilisation is proceeding as planned:
- Site office modules arrived this morning (4 Feb) - installation underway
- Temporary fencing will be installed around our working area by 8 February
- Site access control system being set up (we'll coordinate with Branko on handover of security responsibilities)
- Welfare facilities (changing rooms, toilets, canteen) arriving 11 February
- Survey control network being established this week

**Excluded Northeastern Area:**

We note the temporary exclusion of the northeastern area (approximately 2.1 hectares) pending resolution of the easement matter with Klow Chemical Works. 

I have reviewed this with our planning team. The excluded area is not required for our immediate works (next 60 days), as you correctly anticipated. However, we will need access to this area by mid-April for:
- Ground investigation boreholes in that zone
- Installation of site drainage infrastructure
- Laydown area during the civil works peak (summer 2019)

Could you please keep us informed of progress on resolving the access issue? If there is any risk the matter will not be resolved within the 60-day timeframe you mentioned, please let us know as soon as possible so we can assess potential impact on our programme and consider mitigation measures.

Formal acknowledgment of site possession (signed form) is being sent under separate cover by Miroslav today.

**Next Steps:**

Our immediate focus this week is completing site establishment. We will have our first weekly progress meeting on site on Wednesday 6 February at 10:00. Branko has confirmed he will attend.

Thanks to you and Branko for the smooth handover process. We're excited to officially start work on site!

Best regards,
