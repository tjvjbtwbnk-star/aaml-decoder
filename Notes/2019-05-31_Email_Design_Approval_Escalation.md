**Subject:** Design Approval Concerns - Escalation
---

Dear Dr. Vladić,

I am writing to you directly on a matter that I believe warrants senior attention as we approach the critical milestone of Basic Design Approval.

**Background:**

As discussed at PMM-005 on Monday, we are targeting Basic Design Approval on 12 June 2019. While progress through the Design Task Force has been excellent, I want to ensure there is alignment at senior level on the implications of the design approval timeline.

**Current Position:**

- Basic Design Approval will be achieved approximately 58 days after the contractual milestone of 15 April 2019
- This delay has consumed the majority of the project's original float
- The GT1 foundation design, necessitated by the ground conditions discovery, adds further complexity

**SPCC's Perspective:**

I want to be transparent about SPCC's position:

1. **Mixed Responsibility:** We acknowledge that some of the design approval delay is attributable to SPCC (initial submission quality). However, we also maintain that significant factors were beyond our control:
   - Review periods that exceeded contractual timeframes
   - The ground conditions discovery (DE-002)
   - Additional design development requests beyond Basic Design scope

2. **Recovery Commitment:** SPCC is fully committed to the recovery programme presented at PMM-005. We are investing significant resources in acceleration measures, many at our own cost.

3. **Entitlement Claims:** We will be pursuing entitlement claims for Employer-caused delays (DE-001, DE-002, and potentially DE-003 for the cooling system). These claims are not intended to be adversarial but reflect our genuine entitlements under the Contract.

4. **Collaborative Approach:** Despite the commercial matters, SPCC remains committed to a collaborative working relationship. The success of the Design Task Force demonstrates what can be achieved when parties work together constructively.

**Concerns:**

My concern is that as we move into the intensive construction phase (Q3-Q4 2019), there is potential for the relationship to become strained by:
- Accumulation of unresolved claims
- Pressure to accelerate without agreed compensation
- Disagreements on responsibility for delays

I believe it is in both parties' interests to address these matters proactively rather than allowing them to accumulate.

**Proposal:**

I would like to propose a senior-level meeting (you, me, and Dr. Weber) to discuss:

1. Overall project health and relationship
2. Approach to resolving open claims (DE-001 cost, DE-002, potentially DE-003)
3. Commercial framework for recovery measures
4. Mechanisms to avoid future disputes

This meeting would be separate from the routine PMMs and would focus on strategic alignment rather than day-to-day matters.

I believe such a discussion would be valuable in setting the right tone for the next phase of the project.

I am available at your convenience and would suggest a date in the week of 10-14 June, perhaps after Basic Design Approval is achieved.

I hope you will receive this email in the constructive spirit in which it is intended. SPCC remains committed to delivering a successful project for BEU.

Best regards,
