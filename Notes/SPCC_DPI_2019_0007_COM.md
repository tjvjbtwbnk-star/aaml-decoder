**Subject: Notice of Dissatisfaction – Engineer's Determination on Foundation Completion Delay**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 3.5; DPI/SPCC/2019/0010-DET dated 10 September 2019**

Dear Dr. Weber,

**1. Notice**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 of the Conditions of Contract, the Contractor hereby gives notice of dissatisfaction with the Engineer's determination dated 10 September 2019 (ref: DPI/SPCC/2019/0010-DET) regarding the attribution of delay to the Foundation Completion milestone.

**2. The Determination**

The Engineer determined that:

(a) The 6-day delay to Foundation Completion is attributed as:
- 5 days: Employer risk (HRSG unforeseen ground conditions / VO-004)
- 1 day: Contractor risk

(b) Delay damages of EUR 25,000 are payable by the Contractor for the 1 day of Contractor-caused delay.

**3. Grounds for Dissatisfaction**

The Contractor is dissatisfied with the determination on the following grounds:

**3.1 Mischaracterisation of GT1 Delay Causes**

The Engineer attributed the 1-day Contractor delay to "GT1 foundation works" including harder ground conditions during piling and pile cap formwork complexity. The Contractor does not accept this characterisation:

(a) **GT1 Piling Conditions:** The harder rock encountered during GT1 piling (SPT N>60) was significantly harder than indicated in the Employer's geotechnical data (N=35-45). This constitutes an Unforeseeable Physical Condition under Sub-Clause 4.12, which is the subject of the Contractor's ongoing claim DE-002.

(b) **Recovery Measures:** The Contractor implemented substantial recovery measures at its own cost (EUR 68,000) which recovered approximately 5 days of delay. The Engineer cannot both credit the Contractor for recovery and attribute delay to the Contractor – the net effect of Contractor performance was positive, not negative.

(c) **BCC Performance:** The Engineer attributed BCC productivity issues to the Contractor. While the Contractor accepts responsibility for its subcontractors, the BCC issues were partly caused by the extended recovery measures implemented at the Contractor's cost.

**3.2 Flawed Concurrent Delay Analysis**

The Engineer's concurrent delay analysis is flawed:

(a) The GT1 delays occurred before the HRSG ground conditions issue was discovered on 2 August 2019.

(b) The HRSG issue then became critical. However, this does not extinguish the Contractor's entitlement for the GT1 issues – it merely means they became non-critical.

(c) Under established delay analysis principles (SCL Protocol), where Employer risk events and Contractor risk events are concurrent on the critical path, the Contractor is entitled to EOT but not to prolongation costs. This does not mean the Contractor is liable for delay damages.

(d) The GT1 issues (if accepted as Contractor risk, which is disputed) were off the critical path at the time they were occurring because the critical path had shifted to HRSG. No delay damages should be attributable.

**3.3 Recovery Measures Not Credited**

The Contractor implemented the following recovery measures:

| Measure | Cost (EUR) | Days Recovered |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| GT1 night shift | 45,000 | 3 |
| Three-pour pile cap | 15,000 | 2 |
| High-early concrete | 8,000 | 2 |
| **Total** | **68,000** | **7** |

Without these measures, the delay would have been 13+ days. The Contractor's efforts reduced this to 6 days. The Engineer should recognise this positive contribution, not penalise the Contractor with delay damages.

**3.4 Proportionality**

Even if the Engineer's analysis were correct (which is not accepted), the attribution of only 1 day of Contractor delay out of a complex sequence of events involving multiple unforeseeable conditions suggests that this is within the normal variation of construction performance. Applying delay damages in such circumstances is disproportionate.

**4. Contractor's Position**

The Contractor maintains that:

(a) All 6 days of delay to Foundation Completion are attributable to Employer risk events, specifically:
- 5 days: HRSG unforeseen ground conditions (VO-004)
- 1 day: GT1 ground conditions (part of DE-002 claim)

(b) No delay damages are payable by the Contractor.

(c) The EUR 25,000 deducted from IPC No. 9 should be reversed.

**5. Request for Reconsideration**

5.1 The Contractor requests that the Engineer reconsider this determination in light of the above submissions.

5.2 If the Engineer is not willing to revise the determination, the Contractor reserves its right to refer this matter to dispute resolution in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.4.

5.3 We propose a meeting to discuss this matter further before any escalation.

**6. Effect of Notice**

This notice of dissatisfaction is given within 28 days of the determination, in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5. The determination therefore does not become final and binding.

This notice is given without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to the Contractor under the Contract or at law.

Yours sincerely,
