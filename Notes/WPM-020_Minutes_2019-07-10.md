- Water stations increased from 8 to 12 across site
- Work schedules adjusted: concrete pours now starting at 06:00 where possible
- Near-miss: Forklift near-contact with pedestrian in laydown area on 9 July. Area now cordoned with designated crossing points.

I. Petrović (BEU) expressed concern about the heat exhaustion incidents and enquired about rest break provisions. P. Horváth confirmed mandatory 15-minute rest breaks every 2 hours when temperature exceeds 33°C, with shaded rest areas provided.

**Action:** P. Horváth to provide weekly heat stress summary to BEU through summer period.

### 3. Design Progress

M. Dvořák reported on behalf of Dr. Braun:

- Detailed Design overall: 33% complete (was 31% last week)
  - Civil/Structural: 48%
  - Mechanical: 31%
  - Electrical/I&C: 24%
  - Cooling System: 0% (on hold)
- Dr. Braun in Munich for CoolTech preliminary design meeting (9-10 July)
- BEU comments on Civil Package (BEU/SPCC/2019/0016-TEC) received; response in preparation
- Design Task Force Meeting No. 16 held 8 July – productive session on HRSG interfaces

D. Kostić (BEU) noted the Civil Package comments issued yesterday and requested priority attention to the high priority items. M. Dvořák confirmed responses to high priority items will be provided by 18 July.

D. Kostić also raised the issue of seismic design basis verification following recent updates to regional seismic hazard maps. M. Dvořák noted this is under review with the geotechnical consultant.

**Action:** A. Kováč to provide seismic design basis confirmation by PMM-007.

### 4. Construction Progress

P. Novotný reported:

**4.1 GT1 Bored Piling**
- Piles complete: 9 (GP-01 to GP-09)
- Progress this week: 6 piles (vs 7-8 target)
- Productivity: 1.3 piles/day average
- GP-08 encountered harder stratum at 29m requiring additional drilling time
- Forecast completion: 30 July (was 26 July) – 4 day slip

T. Polák explained that one pile (GP-08) took two days due to unexpected cobbles in the founding stratum. Additional drilling tools mobilised to address similar conditions if encountered.

I. Petrović expressed concern about the slip and asked for daily updates. T. Polák confirmed daily reports are being issued.

**4.2 Admin Building Foundation**
- Pour 5 completed successfully 8 July (195 m³)
- Pour 6 (final) scheduled 15 July
- Foundation will be 100% complete by 15 July

M. Santos (DPI) confirmed the Pour 5 inspection was satisfactory with no issues noted.

**4.3 HRSG Area Foundations**
- Pour 4 scheduled 11 July (rebar installation complete)
- Pour 5 formwork in progress
- Progress: 33% complete (4 of 12 pours)

**4.4 Cooling Tower Area**
- Pour 2 complete (9 July)
- Pour 3 scheduled 16 July
- Progress: 25% complete (2 of 8 pours)

**4.5 Overall Foundation Status**

| Area | Pours Complete | Total Pours | % Complete |
|------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Admin Building | 5 | 6 | 83% |
| HRSG Area | 3 | 12 | 25% |
| Cooling Tower | 2 | 8 | 25% |
| GT1 Area | 0 | 4 | 0% (awaiting piling) |

### 5. Programme Update

M. Dvořák presented:

- SPI: 0.98 (slight slip from 1.00)
- Float: 13 days (was 15 days)
- GT1 piling 4-day slip being absorbed in float
- Critical Path: GT1 piling → GT1 foundation → GT1 setting
- Key milestone: Foundation Completion (1 September 2019) – currently achievable but at risk if further piling delays occur

M. Dvořák presented a revised GT1 sequence showing:
- GT1 piling complete: 30 July
- GT1 pile cap Pour 1: 8 August
- GT1 pile cap complete: 5 September
- Float to milestone: 4 days

I. Petrović stated that the 1 September Foundation Completion milestone is contractually significant and requested SPCC's confirmation that it remains achievable.

M. Horák confirmed SPCC remains committed to the milestone and is exploring acceleration options including additional piling shifts if required.

**Action:** M. Dvořák to provide GT1 acceleration options analysis by 15 July.

### 6. Commercial Matters
