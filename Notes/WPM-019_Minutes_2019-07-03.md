### 2. Safety Report

P. Horváth reported:

- No lost time incidents (LTIs) during the week
- Total man-hours worked: 11,850
- One near-miss incident on 1 July involving a delivery truck reversing in the laydown area. Stop-work meeting held, reversing procedures reinforced
- Heat stress protocols implemented given temperatures exceeding 32°C
- Toolbox talks focused on working at height ahead of foundation formwork activities

B. Simić (BEU) noted the near-miss and requested a copy of the incident report for BEU records.

**Action:** P. Horváth to provide near-miss incident report to BEU by 5 July 2019.

### 3. Design Progress

In the absence of Dr. Braun, M. Dvořák reported on design status:

- Basic Design: Approved 12 June 2019 – milestone achieved
- Detailed Design overall: 31% complete
  - Civil/Structural: 45%
  - Mechanical: 28%
  - Electrical/I&C: 22%
- Design Task Force continuing twice-weekly meetings
- Cooling system detailed design on hold pending DE-003 resolution

D. Kostić (BEU) enquired about the impact of the cooling system hold on overall detailed design progress. M. Dvořák confirmed that other packages can proceed independently but the cooling system represents approximately 12% of the overall detailed design scope.

I. Petrović requested that SPCC provide a design progress report at the upcoming PMM-007 showing the detailed design completion curve against plan.

**Action:** M. Dvořák to include detailed design progress curve in PMM-007 presentation.

### 4. Construction Progress

P. Novotný reported:

**4.1 GT1 Bored Piling**
- Commenced 1 July 2019 as planned
- 3 piles completed as of this morning (piles GP-01, GP-02, GP-03)
- Pile GP-01 reached founding stratum at 31.2m (within specification)
- Tremie concreting proceeding well
- Productivity tracking at 1.0 pile per day (target is 1.5)

A. Kováč explained that the first piles are slower due to equipment setup and calibration. Productivity expected to improve to 1.5 piles/day by end of next week.

B. Simić queried the concrete supply arrangements. T. Polák confirmed dedicated batching plant on site for GT1 piles with backup supply agreement with Szohôd Concrete.

**4.2 Foundations**
- Admin Building: Pour 5 of 6 scheduled for 8 July
- HRSG Area: Pours 4 and 5 in preparation, formwork ongoing
- Cooling Tower: Pour 2 formwork in progress

M. Santos (DPI) noted that the HRSG foundation Pour 3 inspection on 28 June identified some minor honeycombing. Requested confirmation of remediation approach.

O. Malý confirmed the honeycombing was superficial and has been repaired by bush hammering and application of non-shrink grout per approved repair procedure.

**4.3 Earthworks**
- All earthworks complete except minor grading around future laydown areas
- Overall: 92% complete

### 5. Programme Update

M. Dvořák presented:

- SPI: 1.00 (baseline recovered)
- Float: 15 days
- Critical Path: GT1 piling → GT1 foundation → GT1 setting
- GT1 piling completion forecast: 26 July (original) – currently tracking to 28 July if productivity remains at 1.0/day
- Key milestone: Foundation Completion (1 September 2019) – currently forecast achievable

I. Petrović expressed concern about the GT1 piling productivity and requested daily reporting on pile installation progress.

**Action:** T. Polák to provide daily pile installation report to BEU until piling complete.

### 6. Commercial Matters

M. Dvořák reported on behalf of J. Procházka:

- IPC No. 5 certified 28 June: EUR 42,350,000
