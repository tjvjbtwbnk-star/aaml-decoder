**Subject: Submission of Recovery Programme Rev 0**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001, Sub-Clause 8.3; BEU/SPCC/2019/0018-PROG dated 25 July 2019**

Dear Mrs. Petrović,

In response to your request of 25 July 2019, we hereby submit the Recovery Programme Rev 0 demonstrating the Contractor's measures to achieve the Foundation Completion milestone and maintain subsequent project milestones.

**1. Introduction**

1.1 This Recovery Programme has been prepared in accordance with Sub-Clause 8.3 of the Conditions of Contract following the Employer's request.

1.2 The programme demonstrates how the Contractor will complete the Foundation Completion milestone by 1 September 2019 despite delays encountered during the GT1 piling operation and achieve subsequent milestones.

1.3 We note that an additional issue has arisen since the Employer's request, namely unforeseen ground conditions discovered in the HRSG area on 2 August 2019. This Recovery Programme addresses this new issue in addition to the matters originally identified.

**2. Current Situation**

**2.1 Progress Status (as at 5 August 2019)**

| Area | Progress | Remaining |
|------|----------|-----------|
| GT1 Bored Piling | 100% | Complete |
| GT1 Pile Cap | 25% | Pour 1 complete, Pours 2&3 in progress |
| Admin Building Foundation | 100% | Complete |
| HRSG Area Foundation | 58% | 5 pours remaining |
| Cooling Tower Foundation | 75% | 2 pours remaining |

**2.2 Issues Addressed**

This Recovery Programme addresses the following issues:

| Issue | Impact | Recovery Potential |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| GT1 piling delay | 5 days | Recovered through acceleration |
| HRSG/CT productivity | 3 days | Recovered through additional resources |
| HRSG unforeseen ground conditions | 12-15 days | Partial recovery through piling |

**3. Recovery Measures**

**3.1 Measures Already Implemented (GT1)**

| Measure | Implementation Date | Days Recovered | Cost (EUR) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| Night shift piling | 23 July | 3 | 45,000 |
| Three-pour pile cap sequence | 1 August | 2 | 15,000 |
| High-early-strength concrete | 1 August | 2 | 8,000 |
| **Subtotal** | | **7** | **68,000** |

**3.2 Additional Measures (HRSG Area)**

| Measure | Implementation Date | Days Recovered | Cost (EUR) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| Additional piling (6 piles) | 8 August | -12 (added)* | 185,000 |
| Parallel HRSG sequences | 8 August | 4 | 22,000 |
| Weekend working | 10 August | 3 | 48,000 |
| Additional BCC resources | 5 August | 2 | 35,000** |
| **Subtotal** | | **-3 net** | **290,000** |

*The additional piling adds 12 days to the HRSG sequence but avoids a longer delay from alternative solutions.

**Total recovery cost to date: EUR 358,000**

**3.3 Additional Resources**

| Resource | Original | Recovery | Increase |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| BCC Labour | 89 | 125 | +40% |
| SPCC Supervision | 12 | 16 | +33% |
| Piling Equipment | 1 rig | 2 rigs* | +100% |
| Tower Cranes | 1 | 2** | +100% |

*Second piling rig mobilised for HRSG additional piles
**Second tower crane arriving 10 August

**4. Revised Programme**

**4.1 Foundation Completion Milestone**

| Activity | Original Date | Recovery Date | Status |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| GT1 Pile Cap Complete | 17 Aug | 14 Aug | On track |
| GT1 Foundation Slab | 2 Sep | 28 Aug | On track |
| HRSG Foundations Complete | 25 Aug | 6 Sep | 5 days late |
| Cooling Tower Complete | 28 Aug | 30 Aug | On track |
| **Foundation Completion** | **1 Sep** | **6 Sep** | **5 days late** |

**4.2 Impact Assessment**

Despite the recovery measures, the unforeseen ground conditions at the HRSG area will result in a 5-day delay to the Foundation Completion milestone. This is an Employer risk event under Sub-Clause 4.12, and we will be submitting a formal claim for Extension of Time.

**4.3 Downstream Impact**

| Milestone | Original Date | Revised Date | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Foundation Completion | 1 Sep 2019 | 6 Sep 2019 | +5 days |
| Structural Steel Complete | 15 Mar 2020 | 20 Mar 2020 | +5 days |
| GT1 Setting | 15 Apr 2020 | 20 Apr 2020 | +5 days |

Note: GT1 Delivery (1 March 2020) is unaffected. The 5-day delay can be absorbed in the period between delivery and setting.

**5. Programme Scenarios**

**5.1 Without Claimed EOT**

The Recovery Programme shows achievement of Foundation Completion on 6 September 2019, representing a 5-day delay to the contractual milestone. This delay is wholly attributable to unforeseen ground conditions (Employer risk).

**5.2 With Claimed EOT**

If the following EOT claims are determined favourably:

| Claim | EOT Claimed | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| DE-002 | 68 days | Under review (DPI determined 35 days) |
| DE-003 | 70 days | Under negotiation |
| DE-004 (HRSG ground) | 5 days | To be submitted |

The Time for Completion would be extended accordingly, and the current forecast would be ahead of the (revised) contractual completion date.

**6. Risk Assessment**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Further ground conditions | Medium | High | Monitoring, probe drilling |
| Weather delays | Medium | Medium | Contingency in programme |
| Resource availability | Low | Medium | Subcontract arrangements |
| Material supply | Low | Medium | Stock buffers maintained |

**7. Programme Documentation**

The following documents are enclosed:

1. Recovery Programme Schedule (Primavera P6 – Level 3)
2. Resource Histogram – Original vs Recovery
3. Critical Path Analysis
4. Acceleration Cost Summary
5. Risk Register

**8. Cost Recovery**

8.1 The recovery measures implemented to date (EUR 358,000) have been incurred to mitigate the effects of both Contractor-caused delays and Employer risk events.

8.2 We reserve our right to claim recovery of costs attributable to:
- Unforeseen ground conditions (GT1 piling delays in part, HRSG piling in full)
- Acceleration required due to DE-003 design hold
- Any other Employer risk events

8.3 We will provide a detailed cost breakdown with our formal claims.

**9. Monitoring and Reporting**

9.1 Progress against the Recovery Programme will be reported weekly at WPM meetings.

9.2 A dashboard showing recovery measure status will be issued with each weekly report.

9.3 Any deviation from the Recovery Programme will be notified promptly.

We trust this submission meets the Employer's requirements. We remain committed to achieving project milestones and will continue to implement all reasonable recovery measures.

We are available to meet to discuss this programme at your convenience.

Yours sincerely,

**Martin Dvořák**
Planning Manager
