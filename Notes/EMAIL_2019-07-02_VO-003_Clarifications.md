Dear Jiří,

Thank you for the submission of your claim in respect of DE-003 (Cooling System Modification) received yesterday under reference SPCC/BEU/2019/0019-COM dated 3 July 2019.

We are currently reviewing the submission in detail. However, before we can complete our evaluation, we require clarification on the following matters:

**1. Cost Breakdown**

Your submission claims EUR 22,300,000 in additional costs. Please provide a more detailed breakdown of the following items:

a) The EUR 8,450,000 claimed for the hybrid cooling tower supply – please confirm whether this is based on a firm quotation from CoolTech GmbH or an estimate. If a quotation, please provide a copy.

b) The EUR 2,180,000 claimed for "design development" – please clarify how this has been calculated and provide supporting resource schedules.

c) The EUR 4,250,000 claimed for civil works modifications – please confirm whether this includes any contingency and if so, what percentage.

**2. Programme Impact**

Regarding the 85-day EOT claimed:

a) Please provide a more detailed delay analysis showing the critical path impact of the cooling system modification.

b) Your submission indicates design development will take 12 weeks. Please confirm whether this duration assumes design work is carried out in parallel with other activities or sequentially.

c) Please clarify what mitigation measures, if any, have been considered in arriving at the 85-day figure.

**3. Contractual Basis**

a) Your submission references Sub-Clause 13.3 (Variation Procedure). Please confirm whether you are also claiming entitlement under Sub-Clause 13.2 (Value Engineering) given your suggestion that the hybrid system may offer operational benefits.

b) Please confirm the date on which the Contractor considers the "instruction" was given for the purposes of Sub-Clause 13.3.

**4. Technical Queries**

a) Please provide the basis for the stated water consumption reduction from 2,400 m³/hr to 1,400 m³/hr – is this a guaranteed figure from CoolTech?

b) Has any preliminary work been done on the modified cooling tower foundation requirements?

We would appreciate your response to these queries by close of business Friday 12 July 2019 to enable us to progress our evaluation.

Please let me know if you require any clarification on the above.

Best regards,
