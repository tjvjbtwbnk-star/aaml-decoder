| DD-REP-STR-002 | Material Specification Compliance Matrix |
| DD-REP-STR-003 | Interface Coordination Report |
| DD-DWG-STR-IFC | Interface Control Drawings (6 No.) |

**2. Design Basis**

The structural design has been developed in accordance with:

- Eurocode 3: Design of Steel Structures (EN 1993)
- Eurocode 8: Design of Structures for Earthquake Resistance (EN 1998)
- Contract Technical Specifications (Appendix 3)
- Approved Basic Design (12 June 2019)
- Equipment vendor interface drawings (TurboMach, CoolTech)

**3. Key Design Parameters**

| Parameter | Value | Reference |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Design Wind Speed | 45 m/s (3-second gust) | Local Building Code |
| Seismic Zone | Zone 2 (ag = 0.15g) | EN 1998-1, National Annex |
| Snow Load | 1.5 kN/m² | Local Building Code |
| Crane Capacity (Turbine Hall) | 250 tonnes | Equipment requirement |
| Design Life | 30 years | Contract requirement |

**4. Interface Coordination**

This submission has been coordinated with the following equipment vendors:

| Vendor | Interface Items | Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| TurboMach AG | GT sole plates, maintenance crane rails | Confirmed |
| CoolTech GmbH | HRSG support structure, stack connection | Confirmed (subject to DE-003) |
| Sildavo Electrical | Transformer plinths, switchgear room | Confirmed |
| Balkan Steel Structures | Fabrication requirements | Confirmed |

**5. Notes and Qualifications**

5.1 Cooling tower structural design (CT-STR-001 to 018) is based on preliminary hybrid cooling tower parameters from CoolTech. These drawings are submitted for review but are subject to revision once DE-003 is resolved and final equipment parameters are confirmed.

5.2 Seismic design is based on Zone 2 criteria per the National Annex to EN 1998. We note the Employer's comments regarding recent updates to regional seismic hazard maps (BEU/SPCC/2019/0016-TEC). Our geotechnical consultant is reviewing the updated mapping and will provide confirmation that Zone 2 remains appropriate for this site by 23 July 2019.

5.3 Certain connection details are shown as "typical" and will be detailed in the Shop Drawing phase by the steel fabricator (Balkan Steel Structures). Shop drawings will be submitted separately for approval prior to fabrication.

**6. Review Period**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 5.2, we request the Engineer's comments within 21 calendar days (by 2 August 2019).

Given the construction programme requirements, we would appreciate early indication of any significant issues to allow parallel resolution where possible.

**7. Transmittal**

This submission is made in the following formats:
- Hard copy: 3 sets (1 x Engineer, 1 x Employer, 1 x Site)
- Electronic: PDF format via project document management system (Ref: EDMS-DD-STR-001)
- Native files: Available upon request

We trust this submission meets the requirements of the Contract and look forward to the Engineer's review and comments.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Wilhelm Braun**
