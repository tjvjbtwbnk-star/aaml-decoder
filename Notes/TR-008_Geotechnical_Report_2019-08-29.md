## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the unforeseen ground conditions encountered at the HRSG foundation area and provides technical justification for the additional piling works executed under VO-004. The report demonstrates that the conditions were unforeseeable based on the information available at tender and that the additional piling solution adopted was technically appropriate and cost-effective.

**Key Findings:**
- Localised zone of soft organic clay encountered, not identified in the original geotechnical investigation
- Conditions materially different from those described in the Employer's geotechnical report
- Six additional bored piles successfully installed to founding depth in competent stratum
- Foundation redesign complete and construction progressing

## 3. Original Geotechnical Information

### 3.1 Employer-Provided Data

The Contract included the BGS Report GEO-2019-001 dated October 2018 as part of the Employer's Reference Documents (Appendix 1). This report formed the basis for the Contractor's tender.

### 3.2 Relevant Borehole Data

The HRSG area was characterised by two boreholes:

**BH-12 (Grid Line H2):**
| Depth | Description | SPT N |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 0-0.5m | Topsoil | - |
| 0.5-2.0m | Firm brown clay | 8-10 |
| 2.0-8.0m | Medium dense sand | 18-24 |
| 8.0-12.0m | Dense sand | 32-38 |
| 12.0m+ | Very dense sand/gravel | >50 |

**BH-14 (Grid Line H8):**
| Depth | Description | SPT N |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 0-0.4m | Topsoil | - |
| 0.4-1.8m | Firm brown clay | 7-9 |
| 1.8-7.5m | Medium dense sand | 20-26 |
| 7.5-11.0m | Dense sand | 35-42 |
| 11.0m+ | Very dense sand/gravel | >50 |

### 3.3 Original Design Basis

Based on the above data, the original foundation design for the HRSG area assumed:
- Spread foundations at -2.5m depth
- Bearing stratum: Medium dense sand
- Allowable bearing pressure: 200 kPa
- Groundwater level: Below -5.0m

## 4. Conditions Encountered

### 4.1 Discovery

On 2 August 2019, during excavation for HRSG Foundation Pour 8 (Grid Lines H4-H6), the following conditions were encountered:

| Parameter | Expected | Encountered |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Soil at -2.5m to -3.5m | Medium dense sand | Soft organic clay |
| SPT N value | 18-24 | 4-6 (estimated) |
| Groundwater | Below -5.0m | At -2.8m |
| Bearing capacity | 200 kPa | ~50 kPa |

### 4.2 Description of Conditions

The excavation exposed a layer of soft, dark grey to black organic clay with the following characteristics:
- High moisture content
- Strong organic odour
- Fibrous texture with visible decomposed vegetation
- Very low strength (could be penetrated by hand)
- Thickness: 2.0-4.5m

The organic material is interpreted as an infilled former watercourse or pond, likely a natural feature that was present prior to industrial development of the area.

### 4.3 Witness Statement

The conditions were witnessed by:
- Maria Santos, Resident Engineer (DPI) – present on site 2 August 2019
- Branko Simić, Site Representative (BEU) – present on site 2 August 2019

Both parties confirmed that the conditions were materially different from the geotechnical report.

## 5. Additional Investigation

### 5.1 Scope

Following discovery, SPCC commissioned BGS to undertake additional ground investigation:
- 3 rotary boreholes (BH-A1, BH-A2, BH-A3)
- SPT testing at 1.5m intervals
- Groundwater monitoring
- Laboratory testing of organic samples

### 5.2 Results

**BH-A1 (Grid Line H4.5):**
| Depth | Description | SPT N |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 0-1.8m | Firm brown clay (fill) | 6-8 |
| 1.8-3.0m | Soft organic clay | 3-5 |
| 3.0-6.5m | Very soft organic clay | 2-4 |
| 6.5-8.2m | Loose sand | 8-12 |
| 8.2-12.0m | Dense sand | 34-40 |

**BH-A2 (Grid Line H5):**
| Depth | Description | SPT N |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 0-1.6m | Firm brown clay (fill) | 7-9 |
| 1.6-2.8m | Soft organic clay | 4-6 |
| 2.8-5.8m | Very soft organic clay | 2-5 |
| 5.8-7.8m | Loose sand | 10-14 |
| 7.8-12.0m | Dense sand | 36-42 |

**BH-A3 (Grid Line H6):**
| Depth | Description | SPT N |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 0-1.5m | Firm brown clay (fill) | 6-8 |
| 1.5-3.2m | Soft organic clay | 3-6 |
| 3.2-7.2m | Very soft organic clay | 2-4 |
| 7.2-9.1m | Loose sand | 9-13 |
| 9.1-12.0m | Dense sand | 38-44 |

### 5.3 Laboratory Results

Organic content testing:
| Sample | Organic Content |
|--------|-----------------|
| BH-A1 @ 4.0m | 18.2% |
| BH-A2 @ 4.5m | 22.4% |
| BH-A3 @ 5.0m | 19.8% |

These values significantly exceed the 2-3% organic content that would be expected for natural alluvial deposits.

### 5.4 Extent of Affected Area

Based on the investigation, the affected area is approximately:
- Length: 25m (Grid Lines H4-H6)
- Width: 16m
- Area: ~400 m²
- Depth of organic layer: 2.0-7.2m below ground level

## 6. Unforeseeability Assessment

### 6.1 Definition

Sub-Clause 4.12 defines "Unforeseeable" as:

*"Not reasonably foreseeable by an experienced contractor by the date for submission of the Tender."*

### 6.2 Analysis

**6.2.1 Original Investigation**

The original geotechnical investigation (BGS GEO-2019-001) included 18 boreholes across the site. The nearest boreholes to the affected area (BH-12 and BH-14) were located at Grid Lines H2 and H8 respectively – approximately 30m and 25m from the affected zone.

The borehole spacing was appropriate for typical ground conditions but did not identify the localised anomaly.

**6.2.2 Interpolation**

An experienced contractor would reasonably interpolate between BH-12 and BH-14 and conclude that similar medium dense sand conditions exist throughout the HRSG area. There was no indication in the data to suggest otherwise.

**6.2.3 Site History**

The Contract documents did not include detailed site history information. The industrial zone was developed in the 1970s and no records of former watercourses or ponds were provided.

**6.2.4 Conclusion**

The organic clay deposit was:
- Not identified in the original investigation
- Not indicated by any data provided in the Contract
- Not reasonably foreseeable by interpolation from available boreholes
- A localised geological anomaly (former watercourse)

**The conditions were Unforeseeable Physical Conditions under Sub-Clause 4.12.**

## 7. Technical Solution

### 7.1 Options Considered

| Option | Description | Duration | Cost Estimate |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| A | Ground improvement (vibro-compaction) | 20-25 days | EUR 180,000 |
| B | Ground improvement (stone columns) | 18-22 days | EUR 220,000 |
| C | Deep excavation and replacement | 25-30 days | EUR 280,000 |
| D | Additional bored piles | 12-15 days | EUR 195,000 |
| E | Enlarged spread foundation | Not viable | - |

### 7.2 Option Selection

Option D (additional bored piles) was selected because:
1. Shortest programme duration (critical for milestone)
2. Competitive cost
3. Proven methodology (same as GT1 piles)
4. Reliable capacity in competent founding stratum
5. No uncertainty regarding effectiveness (unlike ground improvement)

### 7.3 Design Solution

The foundation for Pours 8, 9, and 10 was redesigned as a pile-supported raft:
- 6 bored piles (600mm diameter, 12m depth)
- Founding in dense sand stratum (N>35)
- Pile capacity: 2,500 kN (ultimate), 1,250 kN (working)
- Pile cap/raft: 600mm thick reinforced concrete

### 7.4 Execution

All 6 piles were successfully installed between 12-25 August 2019:

| Pile | Founding Depth | SPT at Toe | Status |
|------|----------------|------------|--------|
| HP-01 | 11.8m | 38 | Complete |
| HP-02 | 12.1m | 42 | Complete |
| HP-03 | 11.5m | 36 | Complete |
| HP-04 | 11.9m | 40 | Complete |
| HP-05 | 12.3m | 44 | Complete |
| HP-06 | 12.0m | 41 | Complete |

All piles passed integrity testing.

## 8. Conclusions

8.1 The ground conditions encountered at Grid Lines H4-H6 were Unforeseeable Physical Conditions under Sub-Clause 4.12.

8.2 The conditions were materially different from those indicated in the Employer's geotechnical report.

8.3 An experienced contractor could not reasonably have foreseen these conditions based on the information available.

8.4 The additional piling solution was technically appropriate and cost-effective.

8.5 The works were executed successfully and the affected foundations can now proceed.

## 9. Recommendations

9.1 Probe drilling ahead of excavation should be conducted for remaining foundation areas as a precaution.

9.2 The site history should be investigated further to identify any other potential geological anomalies.

9.3 This report should be used to support the Contractor's claim under VO-004.
