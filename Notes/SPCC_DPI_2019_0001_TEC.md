| SPCC-PR-008 | Performance Guarantees Calculation Basis | A | 18 |
| SPCC-PR-009 | Cooling Water System Design Basis | A | 15 |

**Submission Format:**

As agreed, documents are provided in the following formats:
- Hard copy: 3 sets (submitted under separate cover via courier)
- Electronic: PDF files (attached to this transmittal email)
- Native CAD: AutoCAD files for PFDs (via FTP link provided separately)

**Review Period:**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 5.2, we request your review and comments within 21 days, with target approval date of **14 February 2019**.

**Key Design Parameters:**

The Design Basis Memorandum establishes the fundamental parameters for the Plant design:

**Performance Guarantees (at site conditions, natural gas fuel):**
- Net electrical output: ≥820 MW
- Net efficiency (LHV): ≥58.5%
- Annual availability: ≥92%

**Ambient Design Conditions:**
- Site elevation: 165m above sea level
- Design ambient temperature: 30°C (dry bulb)
- Relative humidity: 60%
- Barometric pressure: 99.6 kPa

**Fuel Specification:**
- Natural gas per specification in Appendix A of Contract
- Higher Heating Value: 39.5 MJ/Nm³
- Composition and properties as per Bordurian National Grid specification

**Configuration:**
- 2 x TurboMach TM-9000H gas turbines (nominal 300 MW each)
- 2 x triple-pressure reheat HRSGs with supplementary firing capability
- 1 x condensing steam turbine (nominal 350 MW)
- Hybrid wet/dry cooling system

**Design Codes and Standards:**

All equipment and systems designed in accordance with applicable international codes and Bordurian national regulations, specifically:
- Pressure vessels: ASME Section VIII
- Piping: ASME B31.1 (power piping)
- Structural steel: Eurocode 3
- Electrical systems: IEC standards
- Local regulations: Bordurian Building Code 2015, Bordurian Electrical Safety Regulations 2017

**Dependencies and Assumptions:**

Please note the following key assumptions underlying this design:
1. Final ground investigation results will confirm soil parameters within the range assumed for preliminary foundation sizing
2. Natural gas supply will meet specification throughout plant life
3. Grid connection will accommodate full plant output at 400kV
4. Cooling water makeup source (River Vlaja) will provide adequate flow and quality year-round

Any significant deviations from these assumptions may require design modifications.

**Interface with Employer's Scope:**

This design assumes the following items will be provided by others as per the Contract:
- Natural gas supply pipeline to plant battery limits
- 400kV transmission line and connection to grid
- Access roads to site boundary
- Water supply for construction and operation (to be confirmed)

**Coordination with Subsequent Batches:**

This submission establishes the overall performance basis and main process design. Subsequent batches (Civil/Structural, Mechanical Systems, Electrical Systems) will be developed consistent with these baseline parameters.

Should you require any clarification or additional information to support your review, please contact me or Dr. Yuki Tanaka, our Lead Process Engineer.

We look forward to receiving your comments and approval.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Wilhelm Braun**  
Engineering Manager  
Syldavian Power Construction Consortium

**Enclosures:**
- Design documents as listed (electronic format)
- Document Transmittal Form DPI-001
