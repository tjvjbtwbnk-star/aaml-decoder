**Subject:** RE: Grid Data - Employer Not Responsible
---

Dear Jiří,

I acknowledge receipt of your letter SPCC/BEU/2019/0027-COM dated 22 August 2019 concerning the grid connection data.

While we will provide a formal response in due course, I wish to make the following preliminary observations:

**1. Employer's Position**

The Employer does not accept that the circumstances described in your notice give rise to entitlement under Sub-Clause 1.9 or any other provision of the Contract.

**2. Contractual Responsibility**

2.1 The grid connection data is required for the Contractor's design of the Works. Under Sub-Clause 5.1, the Contractor is responsible for the design of the Works.

2.2 The Contract does not include any obligation on the Employer to provide grid connection data. The Employer's Reference Documents (Appendix 1 to the Contract) do not include TSO data.

2.3 Interface coordination with third parties, including the TSO, is the Contractor's responsibility as part of its design obligations.

**3. Employer's Assistance**

3.1 The Employer has voluntarily assisted the Contractor in facilitating communication with the TSO. This assistance was provided as a matter of goodwill and does not create any contractual obligation.

3.2 The fact that the Employer has been liaising with the TSO on the Contractor's behalf does not transfer responsibility for the design interface to the Employer.

**4. Contractor's Design Approach**

4.1 The Contractor should have anticipated the need for grid data and made appropriate allowances in its design programme.

4.2 An experienced contractor would proceed with design development using reasonable assumptions and adjust as necessary when actual data becomes available.

4.3 The protection system design parameters are within industry-standard ranges and should not require fundamental redesign when TSO data is confirmed.

**5. Delay**

5.1 We do not accept that any delay to the Works is attributable to the Employer.

5.2 The Contractor's design programme appears to have been optimistic in its assumptions regarding third-party data availability.

5.3 Any delay is the Contractor's risk under the Contract.

**6. Next Steps**

6.1 The Employer will provide a full response to your notice within 14 days.

6.2 Notwithstanding our position, we confirm that the TSO data is now expected by 28 August 2019 and will be transmitted immediately upon receipt.

6.3 We suggest a technical meeting following receipt of the data to ensure efficient incorporation into the design.

Please note this email does not constitute a formal response to your notice and is provided for preliminary information only.

Regards,
