**Subject: VO-003 – Employer's Position on Entitlement**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; SPCC/BEU/2019/0019-COM dated 3 July 2019; SPCC/BEU/2019/0021-COM dated 4 July 2019**

Dear Mr. Procházka,

We refer to your claim submission of 3 July 2019 and subsequent clarification responses of 4 July 2019 in respect of DE-003 (Cooling System Modification). We have now completed our review of your submissions and set out below the Employer's position on entitlement.

**1. Background**

1.1 On 5 June 2019, the Employer issued instruction BEU/SPCC/2019/0013-TEC requiring the Contractor to modify the cooling system design to incorporate a hybrid wet/dry cooling tower in compliance with Ministry of Environment Regulation No. 2019/127.

1.2 The Contractor has submitted a claim for:
- Extension of Time: 85 calendar days
- Additional Cost: EUR 22,300,000

**2. Employer's Position on Entitlement – Principle**

2.1 The Employer accepts that the instruction of 5 June 2019 constitutes a Variation within the meaning of Sub-Clause 13.1 of the Conditions of Contract.

2.2 The Employer accepts that the Contractor is entitled to:
- Adjustment of the Contract Price for the reasonable additional cost of complying with the instruction
- Extension of Time to the extent that the Variation causes delay to completion, subject to the Contractor's mitigation obligations

2.3 Accordingly, the Employer accepts in principle that a Variation Order should be issued in respect of this matter.

**3. Employer's Position on Quantum – Cost**

3.1 The Employer does not accept the cost claimed of EUR 22,300,000. Our assessment of reasonable additional cost is as follows:

| Item | Contractor's Claim | Employer's Assessment | Notes |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Hybrid cooling tower supply | 8,450,000 | 7,200,000 | See 3.2 |
| Design development | 2,180,000 | 1,450,000 | See 3.3 |
| Civil works modifications | 4,250,000 | 3,100,000 | See 3.4 |
| Piping modifications | 3,850,000 | 3,200,000 | See 3.5 |
| Electrical modifications | 1,920,000 | 1,650,000 | See 3.6 |
| Prolongation costs | 1,650,000 | 850,000 | See 3.7 |
| **Total** | **22,300,000** | **17,450,000** | |

3.2 **Hybrid Cooling Tower Supply:** The CoolTech quotation appears to include items that were within the original scope (e.g., cooling tower fans, basin). The Employer's assessment reflects a fair differential cost between the original wet cooling tower and the hybrid system.

3.3 **Design Development:** The Employer considers the resource levels claimed to be excessive and the contingency unreasonable at this stage. The assessment reflects a reasonable engineering effort based on industry norms.

3.4 **Civil Works Modifications:** The 12% contingency is not accepted. The assessment reflects a reasonable estimate of physical works required.

3.5 **Piping Modifications:** Minor adjustment reflecting our assessment of actual scope change.

3.6 **Electrical Modifications:** Minor adjustment reflecting our assessment of actual scope change.

3.7 **Prolongation Costs:** See Section 4 below regarding EOT assessment.

**4. Employer's Position on Quantum – Time**

4.1 The Employer does not accept the 85 calendar days claimed. Our assessment is as follows:

4.2 **Design Impact:** We accept that additional design time is required. However, we consider that:
- The 12-week design period is excessive
- Greater parallelisation is achievable
- The Contractor has not adequately demonstrated why design cannot proceed in parallel with equipment procurement

4.3 **Procurement Impact:** We note the CoolTech quotation indicates 14 weeks additional lead time. However:
- The quotation is dated 18 June 2019
- Order could have been placed provisionally from early July
- Delay could have been reduced through expedited procurement

4.4 **Construction Impact:** We accept that foundation modifications will cause some delay. However, this work can be substantially parallelised with other activities.

4.5 **Mitigation:** The Employer considers that the Contractor has not adequately demonstrated mitigation efforts. In particular:
- Night shift working on design has not been proposed
- Expedited procurement options not fully explored
- Alternative suppliers not investigated

4.6 **Employer's EOT Assessment:** Based on the above, the Employer considers that a fair Extension of Time is **45 calendar days**.

**5. Foreseeability**

5.1 Without prejudice to the above, the Employer notes that:
- Environmental regulations in Borduria have been progressively tightening
- The Ministry of Environment had publicly announced its intention to introduce stricter thermal discharge limits in 2018
- A prudent contractor could reasonably have anticipated the possibility of such requirements

5.2 The Employer reserves its position on whether the full impact of this change should be the Employer's responsibility in light of the above. However, in the interests of reaching a commercial resolution, the Employer is prepared to proceed on the basis set out in Sections 3 and 4 above.

**6. Proposed Way Forward**

6.1 The Employer proposes that a Variation Order be issued on the following basis:
- **Additional Cost:** EUR 17,450,000
- **Extension of Time:** 45 calendar days
- **Revised Completion Date:** 28 February 2023

6.2 This offer is made on a without prejudice basis and is open for acceptance until 31 July 2019.

6.3 Should the Contractor not accept this offer, the Employer requests that the Contractor provide:
- Detailed substantiation of all cost items with supporting quotations and calculations
- A fully resourced delay analysis demonstrating the critical path impact
- Evidence of mitigation measures considered and implemented

6.4 The Employer remains willing to meet to discuss this matter. A meeting on 22 or 23 July would be convenient.

**7. Interim Arrangements**

7.1 Pending resolution of this matter, the Employer confirms that the Contractor should proceed with the cooling system modification as instructed.

7.2 The Employer will consider an interim payment application in respect of design costs already incurred, subject to appropriate substantiation.

We look forward to resolving this matter promptly in the interests of the Project.

Yours sincerely,

**Ana Nikolić**
