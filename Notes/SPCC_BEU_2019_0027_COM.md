**Subject: Notice Under Sub-Clause 1.9 – Late Grid Connection Data**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clauses 1.9, 8.4, and 20.1**

Dear Mrs. Nikolić,

**1. Notice**

1.1 This letter constitutes formal notice pursuant to Sub-Clause 1.9 (Delayed Drawings or Instructions) and Sub-Clause 20.1 (Contractor's Claims) of the Conditions of Contract.

1.2 The Contractor gives notice that it has been delayed and has incurred additional cost as a result of the Employer's failure to provide grid connection data within a time which gives the Contractor reasonable time to perform its design obligations.

**2. Background**

2.1 In order to complete the detailed electrical design for the Works, the Contractor requires certain technical data from the Transmission System Operator (TSO), which data is to be provided through the Employer.

2.2 The required data includes:
- Grid fault level at 400kV connection point
- Grid impedance characteristics
- System frequency variation data
- Grid voltage profile (operating range)
- Protection coordination requirements

2.3 This data was formally requested on 15 March 2019, with delivery expected by June 2019.

2.4 As at the date of this notice, the data has not been provided. The Employer has indicated that delivery is now expected by 28-30 August 2019 – a delay of approximately 10-12 weeks from the expected delivery date.

**3. Contractual Basis**

3.1 Sub-Clause 1.9 provides:

*"The Employer shall give notice to the Contractor of any information... which is necessary for the execution of the Works... within a time which gives the Contractor reasonable time to perform his obligations under the Contract."*

3.2 The grid connection data is clearly "information necessary for the execution of the Works" – specifically, it is essential for the detailed electrical design.

3.3 The data has not been provided within a time giving the Contractor reasonable time to perform its design obligations. The detailed electrical design is now delayed by approximately 3 weeks as a direct result.

3.4 Sub-Clause 1.9 further provides:

*"If... the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost as a result of a failure of the Employer to give such notice within such time, the Contractor shall give notice to the Employer and shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1... to:
(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4; and
(b) payment of any such Cost plus reasonable profit..."*

**4. Impact**

**4.1 Design Impact**

| Design Element | % of Electrical Scope | Status |
|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| Protection system design | 15% | On hold |
| Power quality equipment | 5% | On hold |
| Control system interfaces | 8% | On hold |
| **Total affected** | **28%** | |

The detailed electrical design cannot proceed beyond approximately 72% completion without this data.

**4.2 Programme Impact**

The delay to detailed electrical design has the following downstream impacts:

| Activity | Original Completion | Revised Completion | Delay |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Electrical detailed design | 30 Sep 2019 | 21 Oct 2019 | 21 days |
| Protection system procurement | 15 Oct 2019 | 5 Nov 2019 | 21 days |
| GT control software finalisation | 31 Aug 2019 | 21 Sep 2019 | 21 days |

**Critical Issue:** TurboMach requires confirmed protection settings by 31 August 2019 to complete GT control software. The delay in grid data will delay this deliverable, with potential knock-on impact to GT commissioning.

**4.3 Cost Impact**

The Contractor has incurred and will incur the following costs:

| Item | Period | Rate | Amount (EUR) |
|------|--------|------|--------------|
| Electrical design team standing time | 6 weeks | 12,500/week | 75,000 |
| Extended design office overhead | 3 weeks | 8,000/week | 24,000 |
| TurboMach delay costs | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Potential rework if assumptions incorrect | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **Preliminary Total** | | | **99,000+** |

**5. Claim**

5.1 The Contractor claims entitlement to:

(a) **Extension of Time:** The delay impact is currently assessed at **21 calendar days** on the detailed design completion. The critical path impact on Taking Over will be assessed when the full effect can be determined.

(b) **Additional Cost:** Preliminary assessment of **EUR 99,000** plus further costs to be quantified.

5.2 A detailed claim submission will be provided within 42 days of this notice in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.

**6. Mitigation**

6.1 The Contractor has taken the following measures to mitigate the impact:

- Proceeded with design development using assumed grid parameters based on regional typical values
- Engaged TurboMach in discussions regarding control software flexibility
- Prioritised other electrical design elements that do not depend on grid data
- Prepared for rapid design completion once data is received

6.2 Notwithstanding these measures, if the actual grid parameters differ significantly from assumptions, design rework will be required.

**7. Request**

7.1 The Contractor requests that the Employer:

(a) Take all necessary steps to expedite provision of the grid connection data;

(b) Provide the data by no later than 28 August 2019 as indicated;

(c) Acknowledge this notice and the Contractor's entitlement in principle to Extension of Time and additional costs.

7.2 If the data is received by 28 August 2019, the delay impact may be reduced through acceleration measures. However, the Contractor reserves its entitlement to recover the costs of such acceleration.

**8. Reservation of Rights**

8.1 This notice is given without prejudice to any other rights or remedies the Contractor may have under the Contract or at law.

8.2 The Contractor reserves the right to update this claim as the full impact becomes apparent.

We look forward to your acknowledgement of this notice and confirmation that the Employer is taking all necessary steps to provide the required data.

Yours sincerely,
