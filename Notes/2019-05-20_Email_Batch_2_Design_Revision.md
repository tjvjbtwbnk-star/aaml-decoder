Dear Emilia,

Thank you for the productive discussion at the Design Task Force meeting on Friday. I wanted to provide a status update on our responses to the outstanding Batch 2 comments and confirm our submission timeline.

**BATCH 2 REV B STATUS:**

As you know, we submitted Batch 2 Rev B on 15 May addressing the three Category B comments from your review of 3 May:

| Comment | Issue | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| B-53 | Admin Building floor level discrepancy | Coordinated with architectural drawings; civil drawings revised to match +102.150m FFL |
| B-54 | Cable duct clash with piled foundation | Duct routing revised to avoid pile zone; interface drawing updated |
| B-55 | Design code inconsistency (EC3 vs AISC) | Confirmed EC3 as primary code; load combination tables revised for consistency |

I understand from our Friday discussion that you are reviewing these responses and expect to complete the review by end of this week.

**GT1 FOUNDATION DESIGN:**

The GT1 foundation package is progressing well:

| Deliverable | Status | Target |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Preliminary pile layout | Submitted 17 May | Complete |
| Structural calculations | 80% complete | 24 May |
| Foundation drawings | In preparation | 31 May |
| Specification and method statement | In preparation | 31 May |

I would like to propose that we include the GT1 foundation package in the next Design Task Force meeting (Friday 24 May) for an informal review before formal submission. This would allow us to address any concerns early and potentially expedite the approval process.

**BATCH 3 AND 4:**

| Package | Status | Expected Approval |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Batch 3 (Mechanical) | Responses submitted 14 May; DPI reviewing | 31 May |
| Batch 4 (Electrical/I&C) | Responses in preparation; submission 22 May | 7 June |

**BASIC DESIGN APPROVAL TARGET:**

Based on current progress, I remain confident that we can achieve Basic Design Approval by 12 June 2019, as forecast. The key dependencies are:

1. DPI approval of Batch 2 Rev B by 24 May
2. DPI approval of Batch 3 responses by 31 May
3. DPI approval of Batch 4 responses by 7 June
4. GT1 foundation approval by 12 June (expedited review requested)

**DESIGN TASK FORCE:**

The Task Force approach is working well. I believe the direct communication is resolving issues more efficiently than the formal letter process. I suggest we continue with twice-weekly meetings until Basic Design Approval is complete.

**ACTION REQUIRED:**

Could you please confirm:

1. Expected completion date for Batch 2 Rev B review
2. Availability for GT1 foundation discussion on 24 May
3. Any early indications of issues with Batch 3 or 4 responses

Thank you for your continued support in progressing the design approval.

Best regards,
