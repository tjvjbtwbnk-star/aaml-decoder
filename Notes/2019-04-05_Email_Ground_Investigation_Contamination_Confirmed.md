Dear Dragan,

Further to our discussion at WPM-008 on Wednesday and the commitment to provide laboratory results as soon as available, I am writing to confirm that the soil contamination suspected in the Turbine Hall area has now been confirmed by laboratory analysis.

The laboratory report from Balkan Environmental Testing Services (BETS) was received this afternoon. Key findings are as follows:

**Confirmed Contamination:**
- Borehole BH-26: TPH (Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons) at 2,850 mg/kg
- Borehole BH-27: TPH at 4,120 mg/kg  
- Borehole BH-28: TPH at 1,940 mg/kg

For reference, the Bordurian regulatory threshold for industrial land is 1,000 mg/kg TPH. All three boreholes significantly exceed this limit.

**Contamination Depth:**
- Contamination detected at depths between 3.5m and 6.2m
- This coincides with the perched water table / aquifer layer we identified
- Upper soil layers (0-3m) appear unaffected

**Contamination Extent:**
Based on the borehole locations, the contaminated zone appears to extend across an area of approximately 3,200 m² within the GT1 Hall footprint. We are preparing an interpolated contamination map which will be included in the full assessment report.

**Probable Source:**
Historical records (which we have now obtained from the Municipal Archives) indicate that a fuel storage depot operated on this portion of the site from 1965 to 1987. The contamination profile is consistent with a diesel/heavy fuel oil leak during this period.

**Implications:**
As discussed previously, this discovery has significant implications for foundation design and construction methodology. In summary:

1. Contaminated soil cannot be reused on site and will require specialist disposal
2. Dewatering operations will require treatment of extracted groundwater
3. Foundation construction will need to address the aquifer pressure
4. Environmental permits may require updating

I am preparing a comprehensive Soil Contamination Assessment Report which will be submitted early next week (target: Monday 8 April). This will include:
- Full laboratory analysis data
- Contamination extent mapping
- Risk assessment
- Proposed remediation approach options
- Preliminary cost and schedule impact assessment

Given the regulatory exceedance, we will also need to notify the Bordurian Environmental Protection Agency. I understand this is an Employer obligation under the Contract but will await your guidance.

Happy to discuss by phone if useful. I'll be on site all weekend overseeing the additional investigation works.

Best regards,
