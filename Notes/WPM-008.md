### 2. NE Site Area Access Update

B. Simić confirmed that the easement matter with Klow Chemical Works has been resolved. Formal notice of full Site access was issued by BEU on 2 April 2019 (ref: BEU/SPCC/2019/0007-GEN).

M. Horák expressed SPCC's appreciation for BEU's efforts in resolving this matter. He noted that SPCC would be submitting a formal claim for Extension of Time arising from the 60-day period of restricted access.

B. Simić acknowledged that this was anticipated and advised that BEU's Contracts Administrator would respond in due course.

J. Svoboda confirmed that the temporary exclusion fencing has been removed and the NE area is now accessible. Initial survey works in this area will commence on 4 April 2019.

**Action:** WPM-008/01 - J. Svoboda to complete NE area survey and report findings | Due: 10 April 2019

### 3. Ground Conditions Investigation Status

A. Kováč provided an update on the ground conditions situation identified on 27-29 March 2019:

- Perched water table discovered at 5-6m depth in GT Hall area (versus 8-9m expected)
- Confined aquifer with artesian pressure confirmed
- Additional investigation boreholes (BH-25 to BH-30) drilled 1-2 April to delineate extent
- Contaminated soil identified in three boreholes (BH-26, BH-27, BH-28)

D. Kostić enquired about the nature of contamination. A. Kováč advised that preliminary testing indicates hydrocarbon contamination, likely from historical industrial use of the site. Full laboratory analysis is underway with results expected 5-8 April.

M. Santos noted that this constitutes a potentially significant issue and encouraged both parties to work collaboratively toward resolution. She requested that all investigation data be shared with the Engineer.

**Action:** WPM-008/02 - A. Kováč to submit contamination test results to BEU and DPI | Due: 8 April 2019

**Action:** WPM-008/03 - A. Kováč to prepare soil contamination assessment report | Due: 10 April 2019

### 4. Design Development Progress

M. Horák provided a design status update:

**Basic Design Review:**
- Batch 1 Rev A: Final comments addressed, awaiting formal approval
- Batch 2: Comments received from DPI 3 April, responses in preparation
- Batch 3: Under review by Engineer
- Batch 4: Under review by Engineer

M. Santos confirmed that DPI is targeting completion of all Basic Design reviews by end of April, subject to quality of submissions and timely responses from SPCC.

The contractual milestone for Basic Design Approval is 15 April 2019. M. Horák noted that achieving this date is challenging given the current review status.

D. Kostić emphasised the importance of maintaining design quality and not rushing reviews at the expense of technical rigour.
