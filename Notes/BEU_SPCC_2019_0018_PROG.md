**Subject: Request for Recovery Programme**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001, Sub-Clause 8.3**

Dear Mr. Dvořák,

We refer to the discussions at Project Management Meeting No. 7 held earlier today and the programme status as reported in Technical Report TR-007 dated 23 July 2019.

**1. Background**

1.1 The Contractor's current programme (Rev 3.2) indicates that the Foundation Completion milestone (Key Date per the Contract) scheduled for 1 September 2019 is at risk.

1.2 While we note the recovery measures presented by the Contractor and the revised forecast indicating achievement on 30 August 2019, we remain concerned that:

(a) The float on the critical path has been fully consumed;

(b) The recovery depends on multiple measures being successfully implemented;

(c) There is limited contingency should further delays occur;

(d) Other foundation areas (HRSG, Cooling Tower) are also behind programme.

**2. Request for Recovery Programme**

2.1 Pursuant to Sub-Clause 8.3 of the Conditions of Contract, the Employer hereby requests that the Contractor submit a revised programme (Recovery Programme) demonstrating how the Contractor intends to:

(a) Complete the Foundation Completion milestone by 1 September 2019;

(b) Recover the delays in HRSG and Cooling Tower foundation areas;

(c) Maintain subsequent milestones on the critical path to Taking Over.

2.2 Sub-Clause 8.3 states:

*"If at any time... actual progress is too slow to complete within the Time for Completion, and/or progress has fallen (or will fall) behind the current programme... the Contractor shall submit a revised programme... describing the revised methods which the Contractor proposes to adopt in order to expedite progress and complete within the Time for Completion."*

2.3 We consider that the current circumstances meet the threshold for this provision given that:

- Float has been consumed on the critical path
- The milestone was forecast late before recovery measures were implemented
- Progress in HRSG and Cooling Tower areas has fallen behind programme

**3. Required Content**

3.1 The Recovery Programme shall include, as a minimum:

(a) **Revised Schedule:** Level 3 programme in Primavera P6 format showing all activities, logic links, resources, and critical path;

(b) **Recovery Measures:** Detailed description of all acceleration and recovery measures being implemented, including:
- Additional resources (labour, equipment, supervision)
- Extended working hours (shifts, weekends)
- Method changes
- Re-sequencing of activities

(c) **Resource Histogram:** Showing planned versus actual resources and the uplift required for recovery;

(d) **Risk Assessment:** Identification of remaining risks to the programme and mitigation measures;

(e) **Cost Impact:** Indication of any additional costs associated with recovery measures and whether the Contractor intends to seek recovery of such costs.

**4. Submission Date**

4.1 The Contractor shall submit the Recovery Programme within 10 calendar days of this request, i.e., by **5 August 2019**.

4.2 Given the criticality of the Foundation Completion milestone, we would appreciate the Contractor's best efforts to submit earlier if possible.

**5. Clarifications**

5.1 This request is made without prejudice to the Employer's rights under the Contract, including any rights in respect of delay damages should milestones not be achieved.

5.2 The Employer acknowledges that certain delays may be the subject of Extension of Time claims (DE-002, DE-003). The Recovery Programme should show the programme both with and without any claimed EOT to demonstrate the Contractor's position.

5.3 The Employer remains willing to work collaboratively with the Contractor to achieve the project milestones and will give prompt consideration to the Recovery Programme upon submission.

We look forward to receiving the Contractor's submission.

Yours sincerely,

**Ivana Petrović**
Project Manager
