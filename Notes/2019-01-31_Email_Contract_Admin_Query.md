# EMAIL

**From:** Ana Nikolić <a.nikolic@beu.bd>  
**To:** Jiří Procházka <j.prochazka@spcc-jv.com>  
**Cc:** Ivana Petrović <i.petrovic@beu.bd>; Miroslav Horák <m.horak@spcc-jv.com>  
**Date:** 31 January 2019, 09:45  
**Subject:** Contract administration procedures - query

Dear Jiří,

I am currently finalizing BEU's contract administration procedures document (as actioned from PMM-001) and wanted to clarify a few points with you to ensure we are fully aligned.

**1. Payment Application Procedures**

Sub-Clause 14.3 requires the Contractor to submit payment applications to the Engineer (with copy to Employer) by the date stated in the Particular Conditions - which in our case is "within 7 days after the end of each month."

For clarity, this means:
- January work: Statement due by 7 February
- February work: Statement due by 7 March
- And so on...

Can you confirm SPCC will follow this schedule? I note from the kick-off meeting minutes that you mentioned "by 5th of following month" - we should align on the exact date to avoid any misunderstandings.

The payment application should include:
- Statement showing estimated value of work completed
- Breakdown by Bill of Quantities items
- Supporting documentation (delivery tickets, progress photos, etc.)
- Subcontractor payment certificates where applicable

Is this format acceptable, or would SPCC prefer a different structure?

**2. Variation Procedure**

Sub-Clause 13.3 sets out the variation procedure. I wanted to confirm the following process:

**For Employer-initiated variations:**
- BEU instructs Engineer to issue Variation Order
- Engineer issues VO to SPCC
- SPCC submits proposal within 14 days (cost, time, other effects)
- Engineer evaluates and makes determination

**For Contractor-proposed variations:**
- SPCC submits proposal to Engineer (with copy to BEU)
- Engineer reviews and recommends to BEU
- If approved, Engineer issues Variation Order
- SPCC proceeds with work

Does SPCC agree with this interpretation?

**3. Claims Notification**

Sub-Clause 20.1 requires notice of claim "as soon as practicable, and not later than 28 days after the Contractor became aware, or should have become aware, of the event or circumstance."

I want to emphasize the importance of timely notification. We have seen on other projects how delays in claim notification create disputes. If SPCC becomes aware of any event that may entitle you to additional time or cost, please notify promptly - even if the full particulars are not yet known. The 28-day window is strict and we would not want SPCC to lose entitlement due to late notification.

For claims, please use the reference format: SPCC-CLAIM-[Year]-[Number], e.g., SPCC-CLAIM-2019-001.

**4. Document Control**

We discussed document numbering at PMM-001. Can we agree on the following:

**SPCC documents to BEU:**
- Format: SPCC/BEU/[YYYY]/[####]-[CAT]
- Where CAT = GEN (general), TEC (technical), COM (commercial), PROG (programme), HSE, etc.
- Example: SPCC/BEU/2019/0001-GEN

**BEU documents to SPCC:**
- Format: BEU/SPCC/[YYYY]/[####]-[CAT]
- Same category codes

**SPCC documents to Engineer:**
- Format: SPCC/DPI/[YYYY]/[####]-[CAT]

**Engineer's determinations/certificates:**
- Engineer's own reference system (DPI/BCCPP/[YYYY]/[###])

Does this work for SPCC's document control system?

**5. Meeting Minutes and Distribution**

We agreed that minutes should be issued within 3 working days of the meeting. I propose:
- Draft minutes issued by minute-taker (usually SPCC for progress meetings)
- 5 working days for comments from attendees
- Final minutes issued incorporating comments
- If material disagreement on content, noted as "SPCC view" vs "BEU view" in minutes

Is this acceptable?

**6. Communication Protocols - Email vs. Letter**

We should be clear on when email is acceptable and when formal letters are required. I suggest:

**Email acceptable for:**
- Routine technical queries and responses
- Meeting arrangements and agendas
- Requests for information (non-contractual)
- Coordination matters
- Progress updates

**Formal letter required for:**
- Claims and notifications under Contract
- Variation proposals
- Design submissions for approval
- Programme submissions
- Payment applications
- Any contractual notice under FIDIC clauses
- Responses to above

Agree?

I will issue the formal procedures document by Monday 4 February, but wanted to check these points with you first. If you have any concerns or suggestions, please let me know by close of business Friday (tomorrow).

Thanks for your cooperation on getting these administrative matters squared away early - it will really help the project run smoothly.
