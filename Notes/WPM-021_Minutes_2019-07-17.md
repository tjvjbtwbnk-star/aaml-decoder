- Total man-hours worked: 13,100
- Heat stress: One minor case on 15 July, worker returned to duties after 2-hour rest
- Near-misses: None reported
- Toolbox talks: Focus on lifting operations in preparation for increased crane activity
- GT1 FAT team safety briefing conducted for TurboMach facility visit

B. Simić (BEU) acknowledged the heat stress reporting and noted the measures appear to be working effectively.

### 3. Design Progress

M. Dvořák reported:

- Detailed Design overall: 35% complete (was 33%)
- Progress this week primarily in Civil/Structural package
- Structural Package submitted to DPI 12 July (SPCC/DPI/2019/0005-TEC)
- Dr. Braun attending CoolTech meeting in Munich 15-16 July – productive discussions, preliminary agreement on technical parameters
- Design Task Force Meeting No. 17 held 15 July

D. Kostić (BEU) enquired about responses to Civil Package comments (BEU/SPCC/2019/0016-TEC). M. Dvořák confirmed responses to high-priority items are being prepared and will be issued by 19 July.

### 4. Construction Progress

P. Novotný reported:

**4.1 GT1 Bored Piling**
- Piles complete: 14 (GP-01 to GP-14)
- Progress this week: 5 piles
- Productivity improving: 1.4 piles/day achieved Friday-Tuesday
- GP-14 founding stratum at 30.5m (within specification)
- Forecast completion: 28 July (improvement from 30 July)

T. Polák reported that the second shift is now fully effective and two piling rigs are operating in sequence. Concrete supply arrangements confirmed with backup batching plant available.

**4.2 Rebar Delivery Update**
T. Polák reported on the rebar delivery delay:
- Batch 8 delivery received 18 July (2 days late as notified)
- Partial early delivery of 32mm bars achieved 16 July (8 tonnes)
- Impact: HRSG Pour 6 preparation delayed 1 day but recovered
- Current stock: 7 days' coverage

**4.3 Admin Building Foundation**
- Pour 6 completed successfully 15 July
- Admin Building foundation now 100% complete
- Minor punch list items being addressed

M. Santos (DPI) confirmed Pour 6 inspection was satisfactory.

**4.4 HRSG Area Foundations**
- Pour 5 completed 15 July
- Pour 6 preparation underway (rebar installation commenced 17 July)
- Pour 7 excavation in progress
- Progress: 42% complete (5 of 12 pours)

**4.5 Cooling Tower Area**
- Pour 3 completed 16 July
- Pour 4 scheduled 22 July
- Progress: 38% complete (3 of 8 pours)

**4.6 Overall Foundation Status**

| Area | Pours Complete | Total Pours | % Complete |
|------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Admin Building | 6 | 6 | 100% |
| HRSG Area | 5 | 12 | 42% |
| Cooling Tower | 3 | 8 | 38% |
| GT1 Area | 0 | 4 | 0% (awaiting piling) |

### 5. Programme Update

M. Dvořák presented the GT1 acceleration options analysis:

- Current forecast: GT1 piling complete 28 July
- Two options considered for accelerating GT1 pile cap construction:
  1. **Weekend working:** Could save 3 days but has cost implications
  2. **Parallel pour sequence:** Splitting pile cap into two pours (instead of one) allows earlier start

Recommended approach: Proceed with parallel pour sequence (option 2) which recovers the 4-day slip at minimal additional cost.

**Revised GT1 Sequence:**
- GT1 piling complete: 28 July
- GT1 pile cap Pour 1: 5 August
- GT1 pile cap Pour 2: 12 August  
- GT1 foundation complete: 2 September

D. Kostić (BEU) noted that 2 September is still one day late against the 1 September milestone. M. Horák confirmed SPCC will endeavour to recover this through productivity improvements.

**Overall Programme Status:**
- SPI: 0.99
- Float: 13 days
- Critical Path: GT1 works
- Foundation Completion milestone: Currently forecast 2 September (1 day late)

### 6. Commercial Matters

M. Dvořák reported on behalf of J. Procházka:

- IPC No. 6 certified: EUR 36,450,000 (issued 15 July)
- DE-002 (Ground Conditions): Engineer's determination received 16 July – under review
- DE-003 (Cooling System): BEU position received 16 July – under review

B. Simić (BEU) noted the Employer's position on DE-003 and encouraged SPCC to respond promptly given the programme implications.

### 7. Quality Update

O. Malý reported:

- No NCRs raised during the week
- Admin Pour 6 cube tests: 7-day results satisfactory
- GT1 pile concrete: All results compliant (average 43 MPa)
- Upcoming inspections: HRSG Pour 6 (22 July), Cooling Tower Pour 4 (22 July)

M. Todorović (BEU) introduced herself as BEU's Quality Manager and advised she will be attending site weekly going forward. She requested copies of all test certificates and inspection records for BEU quality file.

**Action:** O. Malý to arrange weekly transmission of quality records to BEU.
