**Subject:** Long-lead item procurement status

Dear Ivana,

I wanted to provide you with an update on the procurement status of the key long-lead items, as these are critical to maintaining the project programme. As discussed at the kick-off meeting, we have already commenced procurement activities for the major equipment packages.

**1. Gas Turbines (TurboMach AG)**

- **Equipment:** 2 x TurboMach TM-9000H gas turbines
- **Contract Status:** Purchase order placed 10 December 2018
- **Delivery Schedule:**
  - GT1: 1 March 2020 (to site)
  - GT2: 1 May 2020 (to site)
- **Manufacturing Location:** Winterthur, Switzerland
- **Current Status:** Manufacturing slots confirmed; detailed design in progress
- **Next Milestone:** Factory design review meeting - scheduled March 2019

**2. Heat Recovery Steam Generators (CoolTech Systems GmbH)**

- **Equipment:** 2 x Triple-pressure reheat HRSGs with supplementary firing
- **Contract Status:** Purchase order placed 18 December 2018
- **Delivery Schedule:**
  - HRSG1: June 2020 (modular delivery to site)
  - HRSG2: August 2020 (modular delivery to site)
- **Manufacturing Location:** Duisburg, Germany
- **Current Status:** Engineering commenced; awaiting our finalized process data
- **Next Milestone:** P&ID approval by SPCC - target mid-February

**3. Steam Turbine (TurboMach AG)**

- **Equipment:** 1 x 350 MW condensing steam turbine
- **Contract Status:** Included in package with gas turbines
- **Delivery Schedule:** September 2020 (to site)
- **Manufacturing Location:** Winterthur, Switzerland
- **Current Status:** Preliminary design phase
- **Next Milestone:** Steam conditions confirmation - February 2019

**4. Generator and Electrical Equipment (Sildavo Electrical Works)**

- **Equipment:** 3 x main generators, transformers, HV switchgear
- **Contract Status:** Letter of Intent issued; formal PO in preparation
- **Delivery Schedule:** 
  - Generators: March-May 2020
  - Transformers: June 2020
  - Switchgear: July 2020
- **Manufacturing Location:** Klow, Syldavia (local supplier)
- **Current Status:** Contract negotiations ongoing
- **Next Milestone:** Contract signature target - end February 2019

**5. Cooling System (CoolTech Systems GmbH)**

- **Equipment:** Hybrid cooling towers and circulating water system
- **Contract Status:** Purchase order placed 18 December 2018
- **Delivery Schedule:** April 2020 (fan assemblies and mechanical equipment)
- **Current Status:** Design development ongoing
- **Next Milestone:** Foundation design data - February 2019

**6. Control System (Multiple Suppliers)**

- **Equipment:** Distributed Control System (DCS), instrumentation
- **Contract Status:** DCS supplier selection in progress (3 bidders shortlisted)
- **Delivery Schedule:** 
  - DCS hardware: January 2021
  - Field instrumentation: Progressive deliveries from June 2020
- **Current Status:** Technical evaluation of proposals
- **Next Milestone:** DCS supplier selection - target end February 2019

**Risk Items and Mitigation:**

1. **Gas Turbine Lead Time (60 weeks):** This is on the critical path. We have secured the manufacturing slots and have expediting arrangements in place with TurboMach. Any delays in our design approval process or changes to specifications could impact these dates.

2. **Generator Contract:** While Sildavo is local, formal contract signature is taking longer than expected due to commercial negotiations. We don't anticipate impact to programme, but are monitoring closely.

3. **DCS Selection:** The three-bidder evaluation is taking time due to the complexity of the control system. We need to finalize by end of February to maintain the delivery schedule.

4. **Freight and Logistics:** For the Swiss and German equipment, we have sea freight arrangements via Rotterdam and road transport to Borduria. The gas turbines in particular require special heavy-haul permits which we are arranging with Bordurian authorities.

**Reporting:**

We will provide monthly procurement status reports as part of our progress reporting. These will include updated delivery schedules, payment status, and any issues requiring attention.

If BEU would like more detailed information on any specific equipment package, or if there are particular concerns, please let me know and I can arrange for the relevant technical or commercial personnel to provide additional details.

Best regards,

**František Kučera**
