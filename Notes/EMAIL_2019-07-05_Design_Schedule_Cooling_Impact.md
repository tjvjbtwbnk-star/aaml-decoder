**Subject:** Detailed Design Schedule - Cooling System Impact
---

Dear Dragan,

Further to our discussion at the Design Task Force meeting on Wednesday, I wanted to provide you with an update on the detailed design schedule and in particular the impact of the cooling system modification (DE-003) on our overall design programme.

**Current Status**

As reported, detailed design is currently at 31% complete against a target of 35%. The 4% shortfall is entirely attributable to the hold on cooling system design pending resolution of DE-003. All other packages are progressing at or ahead of plan:

- Civil/Structural: 45% (target 42%) ✓
- Mechanical (excl. cooling): 35% (target 33%) ✓
- Electrical/I&C: 22% (target 21%) ✓
- Cooling System: 0% (target 18%) ✗

**Impact Assessment**

The cooling system design interfaces with multiple other packages:

1. **Civil/Structural** - Foundation design for cooling tower area cannot be finalised until hybrid tower parameters are confirmed. Currently using preliminary dimensions from CoolTech but final design requires order confirmation.

2. **Mechanical** - Circulating water piping, make-up water system, and chemical treatment all require cooling tower parameters. These designs can proceed to 60% on estimated parameters but will require revision once hybrid system is confirmed.

3. **Electrical** - Cooling tower fan motors and drives represent approximately 8% of the electrical scope. Drive parameters affect HV/LV distribution design.

4. **I&C** - Control philosophy for hybrid operation differs significantly from wet-only operation. PLC programming cannot commence until control philosophy is approved.

**Critical Decision Point**

To maintain our detailed design completion target of 30 September 2019, we require a decision on DE-003 by no later than 26 July 2019. This would allow:

- Order placement with CoolTech by 1 August
- Receipt of certified data by mid-August  
- Completion of dependent designs by end-September

If the decision extends beyond 26 July, the detailed design completion date will need to be extended correspondingly. My current estimate is a day-for-day slip beyond that date.

**Proposed Way Forward**

I understand the commercial discussions are ongoing. From a technical perspective, I would suggest:

1. BEU and SPCC agree to proceed with CoolTech's preliminary parameters for design development purposes, with appropriate commercial reservations
2. Design Task Force meetings increase to three per week during July to maintain momentum on non-cooling packages
3. Weekly design progress reports specific to cooling system interfaces be provided to enable early identification of constraints

I am meeting with CoolTech's technical team in Munich next week (9-10 July) for the preliminary design review. If there are any specific technical queries from BEU that you would like me to raise, please let me know by Monday.

I remain concerned that the current uncertainty is affecting team morale and productivity. My designers are understandably frustrated by the stop-start nature of the cooling system work. A clear decision, even if it extends the programme, would be preferable to continued uncertainty.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further. I am available Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning next week.

Best regards,
