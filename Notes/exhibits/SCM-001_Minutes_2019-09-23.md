## Minutes

### 1. Welcome and Introductions

P. Horváth welcomed attendees to the first formal Safety Committee Meeting. He explained that while safety has been discussed at Weekly Progress Meetings, the increasing activity levels and the recent incident require a dedicated safety forum.

### 2. Review of Safety Performance YTD

P. Horváth presented the year-to-date safety statistics:

| Metric | YTD (to 22 Sep) |
|--------|-----------------|
| Man-hours worked | 435,000 |
| Lost Time Incidents | 0 |
| Medical Treatment Cases | 1 |
| First Aid Cases | 12 |
| Near-misses | 26 |
| TRIR | 0.46 |

**Observations:**
- First recordable incident occurred on 18 September after 420,000 man-hours
- Near-miss reporting has improved throughout the year
- First aid cases primarily heat stress (Q2/Q3) and minor cuts/abrasions

I. Petrović (BEU) stated that while the statistics appear good, the recent incident is a warning sign that must be heeded.

### 3. Incident Review – 18 September Lifting Incident

P. Horváth presented a detailed review of the incident:

**Timeline:**
- 14:34 – Beam positioned above installation point
- 14:35 – Sling shifted, beam rotated, contacted platform
- 14:35 – Debris fell, two workers struck
- 14:36 – All stop called, first aid response

**Root Causes:**
1. Single-point lift used instead of two-point (lift plan violation)
2. Appointed rigger absent (supervision failure)
3. Workers in exclusion zone (rule violation)

**Injuries:**
- J. Novák: 4 stitches to forearm – returned to light duties
- P. Stanković: Shoulder bruising – returned to normal duties

B. Simić (BEU) asked why the workers were in the exclusion zone. G. Stanković (BCC) explained that the lift had been in progress for approximately 15 minutes and the workers had assumed the critical phase was over. He acknowledged this was wrong.

M. Horák stated that the incident could have been much more serious. A falling beam or heavier debris could have caused fatalities. This must be treated as a high-potential incident.

### 4. Corrective Actions and Implementation Status

P. Horváth reviewed the corrective actions:

| No. | Action | Owner | Due | Status |
|-----|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Suspend lifting – investigation | SPCC | 18 Sep | Complete |
| 2 | Reinspect rigging equipment | SPCC | 19 Sep | Complete |
| 3 | Rigger retraining | SPCC | 20 Sep | Complete |
| 4 | Two-person rule for lifts >300kg | SPCC | Immediate | Complete |
| 5 | Physical exclusion barriers | SPCC | 23 Sep | Complete |
| 6 | Disciplinary review | BCC | 20 Sep | Complete |
| 7 | Safety alert issued | SPCC | 19 Sep | Complete |
| 8 | Review all lift plans | BSS/SPCC | 23 Sep | Complete |

**Additional Actions:**

| No. | Action | Owner | Due |
|-----|--------|-------|-----|
| 9 | BCC safety management review | BCC/SPCC | 27 Sep |
| 10 | Steel erection safety plan to BEU | SPCC | 25 Sep |
| 11 | BEU observer protocol | SPCC/BEU | 25 Sep |

I. Petrović (BEU) confirmed that items 9, 10, and 11 address her concerns raised on 20 September.

### 5. BCC Safety Management Review

N. Đurić (BCC) presented BCC's safety management arrangements:

**Current Resources:**
| Role | Name | Certification |
|------|------|---------------|
| Site Foreman | G. Stanković | NEBOSH IGC |
| HSE Supervisor | M. Radić | OSHA 30-hour |
| Rigger | D. Marković | Crane operator cert (not rigger) |
| Appointed Person | (Vacant) | - |

**Issue Identified:** BCC does not have a qualified Appointed Person (Lifting Operations). D. Marković holds a crane operator certificate but is not certified as a rigger/signaller.

P. Horváth stated this is a serious gap. The Appointed Person role is critical for safe lifting operations.

N. Đurić committed to:
1. Appoint a qualified Appointed Person (Lifting) within 7 days
2. Send D. Marković for rigger certification training
3. Engage an external lifting supervisor until appointments confirmed

**Disciplinary Outcome:**
D. Marković has received a final written warning. The lift should not have proceeded in the absence of the qualified person.

### 6. Steel Erection Safety Plan

I. Horvat (BSS) presented the steel erection safety arrangements:

**Key Elements:**
- Method statements for each erection phase
- Lift plans for all structural members >100kg
- Temporary works design (platforms, access)
- Fall protection (nets, harnesses, edge protection)
- Exclusion zone requirements

**Enhanced Measures (post-incident):**
- Physical barriers (Heras fencing) for all lifting exclusion zones
- Dedicated signaller at ground level during all lifts
- Two-person rule for all lifts (operator + signaller + ground checker)
- Daily pre-lift briefings
- BEU/DPI notification of critical lifts (>500kg or >10m height)

I. Petrović (BEU) stated that BEU wishes to have observer access to critical lifts. P. Horváth agreed and will include this in the protocol.

### 7. Autumn/Winter Working Arrangements

P. Horváth presented the autumn/winter safety plan:

**Weather Risks:**
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Rain/wet surfaces | Non-slip surfaces, covered walkways, rain delays for lifts |
| Wind | Wind speed monitoring, lift restrictions >25 km/h |
| Reduced daylight | Additional lighting, adjusted shift times |
| Cold temperatures | Welfare facilities, PPE, warm-up breaks |
| Frost/ice | Gritting, surface treatment, delayed starts |

**Trigger Points:**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Wind >25 km/h | Suspend lifting |
| Wind >40 km/h | Suspend all elevated work |
| Heavy rain | Suspend electrical work |
| Ice/frost | Delay start until surfaces clear |

### 8. Any Other Business

**8.1 Stop Work Authority**
I. Petrović requested that BEU site representatives have stop work authority for safety concerns. M. Horák confirmed this is acceptable – any person can stop work if they observe an unsafe condition.

**8.2 Safety Incentive**
P. Horváth proposed a safety recognition programme for workers who report near-misses or demonstrate good safety practices. The meeting agreed this should be developed.

**8.3 Toolbox Talks**
Daily toolbox talks will be enhanced to include specific focus on lifting operations during the steel erection phase.

### 9. Actions Summary

| No. | Action | Owner | Due Date |
|-----|--------|-------|----------|
| SCM-001/01 | Complete BCC safety management review | BCC/SPCC | 27 Sep |
| SCM-001/02 | Appoint qualified Appointed Person (Lifting) | BCC | 30 Sep |
| SCM-001/03 | Submit steel erection safety plan to BEU | SPCC | 25 Sep |
