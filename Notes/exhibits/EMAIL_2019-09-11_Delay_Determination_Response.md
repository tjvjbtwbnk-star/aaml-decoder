**Subject:** Engineer's Determination - Foundation Delay - URGENT
---

Miroslav,

I received the Engineer's determination yesterday evening (DPI/SPCC/2019/0010-DET). The Engineer has attributed 1 day of the Foundation Completion delay to us and assessed delay damages of EUR 25,000.

**My Assessment:**

I do not agree with this determination. The Engineer's analysis has several flaws:

1. **GT1 Ground Conditions:** The Engineer states that the harder ground conditions during piling are "within the range of normal variability." This is incorrect. The SPT values encountered at depth (N>60) were significantly higher than indicated in BH-03 and BH-05 (N=35-45). We have a legitimate claim under DE-002 for these conditions which the Engineer has previously determined at 35 days – although we are seeking reconsideration.

2. **Recovery Measures:** The Engineer acknowledges that we recovered approximately 5 days through acceleration measures. These measures cost us EUR 68,000. The Engineer cannot both credit us with recovery AND attribute delay to us – the delay would have been 3-4 days worse without our efforts.

3. **Concurrent Delay:** The Engineer's concurrent delay analysis is flawed. The GT1 delays were occurring before the HRSG issue was discovered. The HRSG issue then became critical, but this doesn't absolve the Employer of liability for the GT1 issues which were also unforeseeable.

4. **BCC Performance:** The Engineer attributes BCC productivity issues to us. While we accept responsibility for our subcontractors, the BCC issues were partly caused by the extended recovery measures we implemented at our cost to protect the milestone.

**Recommendation:**

We should give notice of dissatisfaction under Sub-Clause 3.5 within the 28-day period. This preserves our right to dispute the determination.

However, I suggest we also consider whether fighting over EUR 25,000 is worth the relationship damage. The commercial situation is:

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Delay damages determined | EUR 25,000 |
| DE-002 claim difference (68d vs 35d) | ~EUR 950,000 |
| DE-004 claim (if successful) | ~EUR 99,000 |
| Recovery measures (unrecovered) | EUR 68,000 |

The bigger issue is the precedent. If we accept this determination, it may signal that we accept liability for other delays too.

**Proposed Actions:**

1. Issue notice of dissatisfaction (deadline: 8 October 2019)
2. Request meeting with BEU to discuss commercial settlement package
3. Prepare detailed rebuttal of Engineer's analysis

Can we discuss this morning before WPM-027?

Regards,
