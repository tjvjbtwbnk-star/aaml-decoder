Dear Dr. Braun,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – COMMENTS ON BASIC DESIGN DOCUMENTS - BATCH 1

Further to our letter ref. DPI/SPCC/2019/0001 dated 28 January 2019, we have completed our review of Basic Design documents - Batch 1 (Process and Performance), submitted on 24 January 2019.

**Documents Reviewed:**

- Design Basis Memorandum (SPCC-PR-001, Rev A)
- Process Flow Diagrams (SPCC-PR-002, Rev A)
- Heat and Mass Balance - ISO Conditions (SPCC-PR-003, Rev A)
- Heat and Mass Balance - Site Conditions (SPCC-PR-004, Rev A)
- Equipment Duty Specifications - Gas Turbines (SPCC-PR-005, Rev A)
- Equipment Duty Specifications - HRSGs (SPCC-PR-006, Rev A)
- Equipment Duty Specifications - Steam Turbine (SPCC-PR-007, Rev A)
- Performance Guarantees Calculation Basis (SPCC-PR-008, Rev A)

## PRINCIPAL COMMENTS REQUIRING ATTENTION

The following major issues (Category A) must be addressed:

**1. Ambient Design Temperature Verification (SPCC-PR-001, Comment A-1)**

The Design Basis Memorandum specifies design ambient temperature of 30°C dry bulb. However, review of meteorological data for the site location (which we have obtained from Bordurian Meteorological Institute) indicates that temperatures exceed 30°C for approximately 15-20 days per year, with maximum recorded temperature of 37°C.

**Requirement:** SPCC must provide justification for the 30°C design point, including:
- Statistical analysis of temperature data (e.g., 2% exceedance temperature)
- Impact assessment of operation at higher ambient temperatures on plant output and reliability
- Statement of guaranteed performance degradation curve from 15°C to 35°C ambient
- Confirmation that 30°C is adequate for equipment sizing (heat exchangers, air intakes, cooling system)

We note this is a fundamental design parameter affecting multiple systems.

**2. Performance Guarantee Test Conditions (SPCC-PR-008, Comments A-3, A-4, A-5)**

The Performance Guarantees Calculation Basis document contains ambiguities regarding test conditions:

**Issue A:** The document presents guaranteed values at "site conditions" but defines these as 20°C/996 mbar/60% RH. This is not consistent with the Contract definition of "site conditions" which means "actual conditions prevailing at the time of test."

**Issue B:** The tolerance bands for ambient conditions during performance testing are not stated. Testing of combined cycle plants requires stable conditions over several hours. Acceptable tolerance bands must be defined.

**Issue C:** The document does not adequately address corrections for off-reference conditions. While it references ISO 2314, the specific correction methodology and acceptable deviation from reference conditions must be clearly stated.

**Requirement:** SPCC must revise Section 3 of this document to:
- Clearly distinguish between "site reference conditions" (for specification purposes) and "actual test conditions"
- Define acceptable tolerance bands for ambient temperature (±°C), pressure (±mbar), humidity (±%)
- Provide correction curves or formulae for off-reference testing
- Confirm the correction methodology will be validated by the GT supplier (TurboMach)

**3. Fuel Gas Specification - Minimum Requirements (SPCC-PR-001, Comment A-2)**

The Design Basis Memorandum assumes a fuel gas specification based on "representative analysis" from the Bordurian grid. However:

- No minimum specification (worst-case composition) is provided
- Potential range of variation in HHV, Wobbe Index, and gas composition is not defined
- Implications of off-specification gas on plant operation are not addressed

**Requirement:** SPCC must:
- Obtain from BEU the contractual fuel gas specification including minimum/maximum values for key parameters
- Demonstrate that the plant design accommodates the full range of expected fuel gas variation
- State any operational limitations if gas quality falls outside specification

We understand from BEU that clarification on this matter has been provided in their letter ref. BEU/SPCC/2019/0003-TEC dated 8 February 2019.

**4. HRSG Design - Supplementary Firing Capability (SPCC-PR-006, Comment A-7)**

The HRSG Equipment Duty Specification indicates supplementary firing capability but does not provide adequate detail on:

- Maximum supplementary firing duty (MW thermal)
- Impact on HRSG outlet temperature and steam parameters
- Effect on plant efficiency and emissions
- Operating modes and control strategy for supplementary firing
- Frequency and duration of supplementary firing operation (design basis)

**Requirement:** The specification must clearly state the supplementary firing design duty and operating regime. This is important for HRSG sizing, materials selection, and lifecycle cost assessment.

We note that supplementary firing may not be economically attractive for a combined cycle plant given the efficiency penalty. BEU should confirm the operational requirement for this feature.

**5. Cooling System - Hybrid Tower Configuration (SPCC-PR-009, Comments A-8, A-9)**

The Cooling Water System Design Basis proposes a hybrid wet/dry cooling tower configuration. While this is technically sound, several issues require clarification:

**Issue A:** The basis for selecting hybrid vs. full wet tower is not explained. A comparison of capital cost, operating cost, water consumption, and performance should be provided.

**Issue B:** The operating strategy for the hybrid tower (when to use wet mode vs. dry mode) is not defined. This significantly affects water consumption estimation and performance predictions.

**Issue C:** Noise emissions from cooling towers are mentioned but not quantified. Given the site's proximity to residential areas, acoustic analysis should be provided.

**Requirement:** SPCC should provide:
- Cooling system selection study comparing alternatives
- Operating strategy and control logic for hybrid tower
- Water consumption estimate under various operating modes
- Preliminary acoustic assessment

## SELECTED MINOR COMMENTS

The following examples illustrate the nature of Category B (Minor) comments:

**Document SPCC-PR-002 (PFDs), Comment B-3:**  
Process Flow Diagram sheet 2 shows auxiliary cooling water pump arrangement but does not clearly indicate redundancy philosophy. Are pumps 100% x 2 or 50% x 3? Please clarify on drawing.

**Document SPCC-PR-005 (GT Specification), Comment B-12:**  
Gas turbine exhaust temperature is stated as "approximately 615°C" - please provide specific value with tolerance (e.g., 615 ± 10°C) as this is critical for HRSG design.

**Document SPCC-PR-001 (Design Basis), Comment B-5:**  
Section 4.2 references "Bordurian Building Code 2015" for structural design. Please confirm this is the latest applicable code or if 2018 amendments apply.

The complete list of Category B comments is provided in Appendix A.

## OBSERVATIONS (CATEGORY C)

Category C observations are provided for information and do not require formal response, though SPCC may wish to consider them in further design development. Examples include:

**Comment C-2:** The selected 2-2-1 configuration (2 GTs, 2 HRSGs, 1 ST) is standard for this plant size and is appropriate.

**Comment C-7:** Heat and mass balance calculations appear to be based on GateCycle or similar industry-standard software, which is acceptable.

**Comment C-14:** We note the cooling system design allows for future dry cooling tower upgrade if water availability becomes constrained. This is good forward planning.

## RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

In accordance with Sub-Clause 5.2 of the Contract, SPCC is required to:

1. **Provide written responses** to all Category A and Category B comments in a Comment Response Matrix format (template provided in Appendix B)

2. **Revise and resubmit** all documents where Category A comments require design changes. Revised documents should be marked "Rev B" with revision clouds/markers indicating changes from Rev A.

3. **Indicate on each response** whether the comment is:
   - **Accepted** - comment will be incorporated as requested
   - **Accepted with clarification** - comment will be incorporated with explanation of SPCC's interpretation
   - **Not accepted** - comment is not agreed, with technical justification

4. **Submit revised documents** within 21 days of this letter, i.e., by **5 March 2019**.

---

## RECOMMENDATION

Based on the number and nature of Category A comments, particularly those affecting fundamental design parameters (ambient conditions, performance guarantees, cooling system), we **cannot recommend approval** of the Basic Design - Batch 1 at this time.

Approval will be subject to satisfactory resolution of Category A comments and adequate response to Category B comments.

We emphasize this should not be viewed negatively - it is normal for a design of this complexity to require iteration, and the comments raised are typical of this stage of design development. SPCC's overall approach is sound and we are confident the outstanding issues can be resolved efficiently.

---

## COORDINATION

We have copied this letter to BEU (Technical Manager) as the comments include several items that may require Employer input or clarification. We suggest a tripartite technical meeting be held to discuss the principal comments before SPCC prepares formal responses.

We note that a technical coordination meeting is already scheduled for 13 February 2019 at 14:00 to discuss design basis queries raised by Dr. Tanaka. The comments in this letter could be incorporated into that meeting agenda.

Should you require any clarification of our comments or wish to discuss our review findings, please do not hesitate to contact myself or Ms. Emilia Kowalska (lead reviewer).

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Heinrich Weber**
