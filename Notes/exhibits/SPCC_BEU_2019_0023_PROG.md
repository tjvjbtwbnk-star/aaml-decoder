**1. Executive Summary**

July 2019 has been characterised by intensive recovery efforts on the civil works programme. The GT1 bored piling operation was completed on 31 July, and recovery measures have been implemented to protect the Foundation Completion milestone. The GT1 Factory Acceptance Test was successfully completed, representing a major milestone for the mechanical works.

**Key Achievements:**
- GT1 FAT completed at TurboMach, Zürich (15-19 July)
- GT1 bored piling completed (31 July) – all 28 piles installed
- Admin Building foundation 100% complete
- Recovery programme implemented successfully
- DE-003 negotiation progressing toward resolution
