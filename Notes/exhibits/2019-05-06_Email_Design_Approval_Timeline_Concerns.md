**Subject:** Design Approval Timeline Concerns
---

Dear Ivana,

I wanted to reach out directly regarding the design approval situation, as I am increasingly concerned about the impact on our overall programme.

**Current Status:**

As you know, the contractual milestone for Basic Design Approval was 15 April 2019. We are now 3 weeks past this date with approval still some way off:

| Batch | Status | Forecast Approval |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Batch 1 | Approved 12 April | Complete |
| Batch 2 | Comments received 3 May; responses in preparation | ~17 May (partial), GT1 TBD |
| Batch 3 | Responses submitted 28 April; under review | ~24 May |
| Batch 4 | Responses submitted 2 May; under review | ~31 May |

Best case, we are looking at full Basic Design Approval around mid-June - approximately 8 weeks late.

**Our Concerns:**

1. **Review Cycle Duration:** While we accept that some of our initial submissions required improvement, the review cycles have been lengthy. For example, our Batch 3 response was submitted on 28 April but we understand review is only just commencing.

2. **Cumulative Impact:** Each day of design delay potentially impacts construction. We have managed to maintain progress by proceeding with certain works based on partial approvals (which we appreciate), but this approach has limits.

3. **GT1 Foundation:** The GT1 foundation redesign, necessitated by ground conditions beyond our control, adds further complexity. We need to ensure this element is prioritised once the remediation approach is confirmed.

**What We Need:**

I would like to propose that we establish a dedicated design review task force with representatives from SPCC, BEU, and DPI that meets twice weekly until Basic Design Approval is complete. This would allow us to:

- Expedite resolution of comments
- Clarify any ambiguities in real-time
- Identify and resolve issues before they become formal comments
- Maintain momentum toward approval

We successfully used this approach on a previous project (Syldavia South CCGT) and it reduced the design approval timeline by approximately 30%.

I am happy to host these meetings at our design office in Klow if that would be helpful, or we can conduct them at Site or via video conference.

**Commercial Position:**

I want to be transparent that SPCC considers the design approval delay to be a mixed-responsibility issue. We acknowledge that some of our initial submissions could have been better, but we also believe that:

- Review periods have exceeded contractual timeframes in some instances
- The ground conditions issue (an Employer risk event) has contributed significantly
- BEU's requests for additional design development beyond the Basic Design scope have added review cycles

We will need to address the commercial aspects of this delay in due course, but my immediate priority is getting the design approved so we can focus on construction.

**Request:**

Could we schedule a call this week to discuss the task force proposal? I am available Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning.

I remain committed to working collaboratively to resolve this matter and get the project back on track.

Best regards,
