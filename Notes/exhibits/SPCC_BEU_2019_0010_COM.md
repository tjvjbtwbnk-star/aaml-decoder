**Subject: Claim for Extension of Time - Delayed Site Access (Discovery Event DE-001)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clauses 2.1 and 8.4**

Dear Ms. Nikolić,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

Further to our notice dated 18 February 2019 (Reference: SPCC/BEU/2019/0004-COM) and the subsequent resolution of the Site access issue as confirmed in the Employer's letter BEU/SPCC/2019/0007-GEN dated 2 April 2019, we hereby submit our detailed claim for Extension of Time arising from the delayed provision of full access to the Site.

This claim is submitted in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1 of the Conditions of Contract.

**2. BACKGROUND**

2.1 Under Sub-Clause 2.1 of the Contract, the Employer undertook to give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of, the Site within the time stated in the Contract Data (being 1 February 2019).

2.2 On 1 February 2019, the Employer provided access to the Site excluding a 2.1 hectare area in the north-eastern corner, which was subject to an unresolved boundary easement matter with the adjacent landowner, Klow Chemical Works.

2.3 Full Site access was not provided until 2 April 2019, representing a delay of **60 calendar days** from the contractual date.

2.4 The Contractor gave timely notice of this matter on 18 February 2019, within 28 days of becoming aware of the circumstances giving rise to this claim.

**3. CONTRACTUAL BASIS**

3.1 Sub-Clause 2.1 requires the Employer to give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of, all parts of the Site.

3.2 Sub-Clause 8.4(a) provides that the Contractor shall be entitled to an extension of time if the Works are delayed by "a Variation (unless an adjustment to the Time for Completion has been agreed under Sub-Clause 13.3) or other substantial change in the quantity of an item of work included in the Contract".

3.3 Sub-Clause 8.4(b) provides entitlement for delay caused by "a cause of delay giving an entitlement to extension of time under a Sub-Clause of these Conditions".

3.4 Sub-Clause 2.1 is such a clause, providing that if no access is given within the time stated, the Contractor shall give notice to the Employer with a request under Sub-Clause 8.4 for extension of time.

**4. IMPACT ON THE WORKS**

4.1 The excluded NE area was programmed to accommodate the following activities:

| Activity | Planned Start | Planned Duration | Impact |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Ground Investigation (BH-17 to BH-24) | 18 Feb 2019 | 8 days | Delayed 43 days |
| Topsoil Strip - NE Area | 1 Mar 2019 | 5 days | Delayed 32 days |
| Mass Excavation - NE Area | 8 Mar 2019 | 12 days | Delayed 25 days |
| Storm Drainage Installation | 22 Mar 2019 | 10 days | Delayed 11 days |

4.2 The NE area contains a portion of the planned laydown area, temporary access road, and stormwater management infrastructure.

4.3 Whilst the Contractor has been able to re-sequence certain activities to mitigate the impact of the restricted access, complete mitigation was not possible. The ground investigation programme, in particular, required access to the NE area to complete the site-wide soil assessment.

4.4 The delayed ground investigation in the NE area has created a gap in the geotechnical data set, which has in turn delayed finalisation of the foundation design in certain areas.

**5. EXTENSION OF TIME CLAIMED**

5.1 Based on a critical path analysis of the impact of the delayed Site access, the Contractor claims an Extension of Time of **45 calendar days**.

5.2 This assessment accounts for:

(a) The actual delay to access of 60 calendar days;

(b) Mitigation measures implemented by the Contractor, including re-sequencing of works in accessible areas;

(c) Concurrent working where possible once access was provided.

5.3 A detailed Time Impact Analysis is attached at **Appendix A**.

**6. SUBSTANTIATION**

The following documents are attached in support of this claim:

- Appendix A: Time Impact Analysis
- Appendix B: Affected Activity Schedule Extract
- Appendix C: Site Layout showing excluded area
- Appendix D: Contemporaneous Site Diary Extracts
- Appendix E: Chronology of Events

**7. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS**

7.1 The Contractor reserves its right to claim additional costs arising from this delay event in a separate submission.

7.2 This claim is submitted without prejudice to any other claims or entitlements under the Contract.

**8. REQUEST**

We respectfully request that the Engineer makes a fair determination of this claim and grants an Extension of Time of 45 calendar days in accordance with Sub-Clause 8.4.

We remain available to discuss this matter and provide any additional information that may be required.

Yours sincerely,

**Jiří Procházka**
Commercial Manager
