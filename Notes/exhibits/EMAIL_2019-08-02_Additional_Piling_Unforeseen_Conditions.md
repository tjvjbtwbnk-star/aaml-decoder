**Subject:** URGENT: Additional Piling Required - Unforeseen Ground Conditions at HRSG Area
---

Tomáš,

I need to advise you of a significant issue that has arisen during the excavation for HRSG Foundation Pour 8.

**Situation**

During excavation this morning for the HRSG Pour 8 foundation (Grid Lines H4-H6), the team encountered unexpected ground conditions that differ significantly from the geotechnical report (BGS Report GEO-2019-001).

**Findings:**

| Parameter | Expected (per GEO report) | Actual |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------|
| Soil type at -3.0m | Medium dense sand | Soft organic clay |
| SPT value | N = 18-22 | Estimated N = 4-6 |
| Groundwater | Below -5.0m | At -2.8m |
| Bearing capacity | 200 kPa | ~50 kPa (estimated) |

I inspected the excavation at 11:00 this morning with Maria Santos (DPI). The exposed soil is clearly unsuitable for the designed spread foundation. There is also evidence of organic material (decomposed vegetation) which suggests this may be an infilled former watercourse or pond.

**Photographs and samples have been taken and are being sent to BGS for analysis.**

**Implications**

The designed spread foundation for this area cannot be constructed on the exposed ground. Options are:

1. **Ground improvement** (e.g., vibro-compaction or stone columns) – estimated 3-4 weeks
2. **Additional piling** – estimated 6-8 piles, 2 weeks
3. **Foundation redesign** – enlarged spread foundation with deeper excavation – may not be viable due to groundwater

My preliminary recommendation is Option 2 (additional piling) as this is most likely to be achievable within a reasonable timeframe and provides a robust solution.

**Immediate Actions Required**

1. **Stop excavation** in the affected area (Grid Lines H4-H6) – I have already instructed the foreman
2. **Protect the excavation** from weather – rain forecast this weekend
3. **Commission additional ground investigation** – trial pit/borehole to determine extent of poor ground
4. **Prepare foundation redesign** – I am starting this now

**Programme Impact**

This affects HRSG Pours 8, 9, and potentially 10. The estimated delay impact is:

| Scenario | Delay |
|----------|-------|
| Ground improvement | 20-25 days |
| Additional piling | 12-15 days |
| Foundation redesign | 8-10 days (if viable) |

**This is a critical issue for the Foundation Completion milestone.**

**Contractual Position**

This appears to be an Unforeseeable Physical Condition under Sub-Clause 4.12. The geotechnical report did not indicate these conditions. I am preparing a technical note for the Commercial team to support a notice.

**Meeting**

I suggest we meet at 16:00 today at the site office with Pavel and Wilhelm to discuss the way forward. I have also requested Maria Santos (DPI) attend as she witnessed the conditions.

Please confirm you can attend and in the meantime ensure the excavation is secured.

Regards,
