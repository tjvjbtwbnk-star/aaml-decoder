**Subject: Comments on Detailed Design – Structural Package (Batch DD-STR-01)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; SPCC/DPI/2019/0005-TEC dated 12 July 2019**

Dear Dr. Braun,

We refer to your submission of 12 July 2019 concerning the Detailed Design – Structural Package (Batch DD-STR-01). We have now completed our technical review in accordance with Sub-Clause 5.2 of the Conditions of Contract.

**1. General**

1.1 The submission is comprehensive and demonstrates a professional approach to the structural design. The documentation is well-organised and generally complies with the Contract requirements.

1.2 We confirm that the design approach and methodology are appropriate for this type of facility.

1.3 Subject to satisfactory resolution of the comments below, we anticipate being in a position to issue consent to the structural package.

**2. Comments Requiring Response**

The following comments require written response and/or revised documentation before consent can be issued:

**2.1 Turbine Hall Structure (Category A – Response Required)**

| Ref | Drawing/Document | Comment |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| 2.1.1 | TH-STR-008 | Crane girder connection detail shows single shear bolts. Please confirm adequacy for fatigue loading given crane duty cycle. |
| 2.1.2 | TH-STR-012 | Column base plate anchor bolt design to be verified. Calculation DD-CALC-STR-001 shows different bolt size (M36) than drawing (M30). |
| 2.1.3 | TH-STR-018 | Wind bracing at Grid Line 7 appears to conflict with GT exhaust duct routing. Please confirm coordination with mechanical layout. |
| 2.1.4 | DD-CALC-STR-001 | Load combination LC-7 (seismic + crane) appears to use incorrect crane position. Please verify. |

**2.2 HRSG Support Structure (Category A – Response Required)**

| Ref | Drawing/Document | Comment |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| 2.2.1 | HR-STR-005 | HRSG module support beam deflection limit not stated. Please confirm L/300 is achieved under operating loads. |
| 2.2.2 | HR-STR-011 | Expansion joint locations at Grid Lines 4 and 8 do not appear to align with HRSG thermal movement requirements. Please verify with CoolTech interface drawing. |
| 2.2.3 | DD-CALC-STR-002 | Pipe support loading assumptions require confirmation from mechanical design team. |

**2.3 Cooling Tower Structure (Category B – Noted for Information)**

| Ref | Drawing/Document | Comment |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| 2.3.1 | CT-STR-001 to 018 | We note these drawings are marked "Subject to DE-003 Resolution." We will defer detailed review until final equipment selection is confirmed. |
| 2.3.2 | CT-STR-004 | Column splice detail at +12.0m requires clarification – is this a bolted or welded connection? |

**2.4 Seismic Design (Category A – Response Required)**

| Ref | Drawing/Document | Comment |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| 2.4.1 | DD-CALC-STR-006 | We have reviewed the updated seismic analysis (Rev 1, 22 July 2019). Zone 2 classification is accepted. |
| 2.4.2 | DD-CALC-STR-006 | Importance factor of 1.2 is appropriate for power generation facilities. Confirmed. |
| 2.4.3 | DD-CALC-STR-006 | Behaviour factor (q) of 2.0 for concentric braced frames requires confirmation. Please provide reference to EN 1998-1 clause supporting this value. |
| 2.4.4 | Various | Please confirm that all connection designs have been checked for capacity design requirements per EN 1998. |

**2.5 Connection Design (Category A – Response Required)**

| Ref | Drawing/Document | Comment |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| 2.5.1 | DD-CALC-STR-005 | Connection design summary is noted. However, detailed calculations for non-typical connections should be provided. We specifically request calculations for: |
| | | - Crane girder to column connection |
| | | - HRSG module support beam end connections |
| | | - Bracing gusset plate connections |
| 2.5.2 | General | Weld sizes shown on typical details should be verified against calculation requirements. |

**2.6 Materials and Specifications (Category B – Noted for Information)**

| Ref | Drawing/Document | Comment |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| 2.6.1 | DD-SPEC-STR-001 | Steel grade S355J2 is appropriate. Confirmed. |
| 2.6.2 | DD-SPEC-STR-003 | Welding specification references AWS D1.1. Please confirm this is compatible with European fabricator qualifications (EN ISO 3834). |
| 2.6.3 | DD-SPEC-STR-004 | Coating system specified (C5-M per ISO 12944) is appropriate for the environment. Confirmed. |

**3. Category Definitions**

- **Category A:** Response required before consent can be issued. Revised documents or written clarification needed.
- **Category B:** Noted for information or minor clarification. Response appreciated but not essential for consent.

**4. Response Requirements**

4.1 Please provide responses to Category A comments within 14 calendar days (by 12 August 2019).

4.2 Responses should be in the form of either:
- Revised drawings/calculations with changes clouded
- Written technical justification with supporting references

4.3 Upon receipt of satisfactory responses, we will issue consent to the structural package within 7 calendar days.

**5. Interface Matters**

5.1 We note that certain structural details are dependent on mechanical interface information (e.g., HRSG thermal movements, pipe support loads). Please ensure that any interface changes are reflected in the structural design and that a formal interface control process is maintained.

5.2 The cooling tower structural design will require re-review once DE-003 is resolved and final equipment parameters are confirmed.

**6. Shop Drawings**

6.1 This review relates to the detailed design (IFC drawings). Shop drawings from the fabricator (Balkan Steel Structures) will be subject to separate review and consent.

6.2 Please allow adequate time for shop drawing review in the procurement schedule.

We remain available to discuss any of the above comments and would be pleased to arrange a technical meeting if that would assist in resolving the issues efficiently.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Heinrich Weber**
