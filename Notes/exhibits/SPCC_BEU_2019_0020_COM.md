**Subject: Variation Proposal - Cooling System Modification (DE-003)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 13.3; Your Ref: BEU/SPCC/2019/0013-TEC dated 5 June 2019**

Dear Ms. Nikolić,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 13.3 of the Conditions of Contract and in response to the Employer's instruction dated 5 June 2019, we hereby submit our proposal for the Cooling System Modification Variation (DE-003).

**2. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**

We acknowledge that this Variation is required due to new environmental regulations (Ministry of Environment Regulation No. 2019/127) and constitutes an Employer-initiated change under Sub-Clause 13.1.

**3. SCOPE OF VARIATION**

The Variation comprises modification of the cooling system from a wet mechanical draft cooling tower to a hybrid (wet/dry) mechanical draft cooling tower, including:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 3.1 | Redesign of cooling system |
| 3.2 | Procurement of hybrid cooling tower |
| 3.3 | Revised civil/structural works |
| 3.4 | Revised mechanical installation |
| 3.5 | Revised electrical/I&C |
| 3.6 | Revised commissioning |

**4. TECHNICAL PROPOSAL**

**4.1 Proposed Solution:**

| Parameter | Original | Revised |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Tower Type | Wet mechanical draft | Hybrid wet/dry |
| Heat Rejection | Evaporative | Combined evaporative/air-cooled |
| ΔT (thermal discharge) | 5°C | 3°C |
| Water Consumption | 2,400 m³/hr | 1,400 m³/hr |
| Plume Abatement | No | Yes |
| Footprint | 45m x 35m | 52m x 42m |
| Height | 25m | 32m |

**4.2 Supplier Quotations:**

Three suppliers have been approached:

| Supplier | Budget Price (EUR) | Delivery |
|----------|-------------------:|----------|
| CoolTech GmbH | 28,500,000 | 18 months |
| SPX Cooling | 30,200,000 | 20 months |
| Hamon | 29,800,000 | 19 months |

CoolTech (current HRSG supplier) is recommended for synergy benefits.

**5. COST PROPOSAL**

| Item | Description | Amount (EUR) |
|------|-------------|-------------:|
| **5.1** | **Equipment** | |
| | Hybrid cooling tower (CoolTech) | 28,500,000 |
| | Less: Original wet tower credit | (14,200,000) |
| | **Net Equipment** | **14,300,000** |
| **5.2** | **Civil/Structural** | |
| | Enlarged foundations | 850,000 |
| | Additional structural steel | 620,000 |
| | Additional concrete works | 480,000 |
| | **Subtotal Civil** | **1,950,000** |
| **5.3** | **Mechanical** | |
| | Additional piping | 420,000 |
| | Revised pumping system | 280,000 |
| | **Subtotal Mechanical** | **700,000** |
| **5.4** | **Electrical/I&C** | |
| | Additional power supply | 380,000 |
| | Revised control system | 220,000 |
| | **Subtotal Electrical** | **600,000** |
| **5.5** | **Design** | |
| | Cooling system redesign | 650,000 |
| | Interface modifications | 180,000 |
| | **Subtotal Design** | **830,000** |
| **5.6** | **Preliminaries** | |
| | Extended site (85 days) | 850,000 |
| | Extended supervision | 425,000 |
| | **Subtotal Preliminaries** | **1,275,000** |
| | | |
| | **SUBTOTAL DIRECT** | **19,655,000** |
| **5.7** | Contractor's Overheads (8%) | 1,572,400 |
| **5.8** | Profit (5%) | 1,061,370 |
| | | |
| | **TOTAL VARIATION** | **22,288,770** |
| | Say | **22,300,000** |

**6. EXTENSION OF TIME**

**6.1 Time Impact Analysis:**

| Activity | Original | Revised | Impact |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| Cooling tower procurement | 14 months | 18 months | +4 months |
| Foundation construction | 8 weeks | 10 weeks | +2 weeks |
| Installation | 12 weeks | 16 weeks | +4 weeks |
| Commissioning | 6 weeks | 8 weeks | +2 weeks |

**6.2 Critical Path Impact:**

The cooling tower is on the critical path for plant commissioning. The extended procurement and construction duration directly affects:
- Cooling system completion
- Plant water commissioning
- Performance testing
- Taking Over

**6.3 EOT Claimed:**

**85 calendar days**

This would adjust the Time for Completion from 14 January 2023 to 9 April 2023.

**7. PROGRAMME**

A revised programme extract showing the hybrid cooling tower activities is attached at Appendix A.

**8. MITIGATION**

We have considered mitigation measures:

| Measure | Potential Recovery | Feasibility |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Expedited procurement | 2-4 weeks | Medium (premium cost) |
| Parallel working | 2 weeks | High |
| Extended hours | 1-2 weeks | High |
| **Total Potential** | **5-8 weeks** | |

With mitigation, the EOT could potentially be reduced to 60-65 days, subject to premium costs for expediting.

**9. PROCUREMENT STATUS**

The original wet cooling tower procurement has been suspended per the Employer's instruction. Costs incurred to date:
- Design development: EUR 85,000
- CoolTech preliminary engineering: EUR 120,000
- Total: EUR 205,000

These costs are not recoverable from the original scope and are included in the Variation cost above.

**10. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION**

| Appendix | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| A | Revised Programme Extract |
| B | Technical Comparison (Wet vs Hybrid) |
| C | Supplier Quotations |
| D | Civil/Structural Impact Assessment |
| E | Cost Build-up Detail |
| F | Time Impact Analysis |

**11. REQUEST**

We respectfully request that the Engineer evaluate this proposal and the Employer issue a Variation Order for:

- **Contract Price Adjustment:** EUR 22,300,000
- **Extension of Time:** 85 calendar days

We are available to discuss this proposal and provide any additional information required.

Yours sincerely,

**Jiří Procházka**
