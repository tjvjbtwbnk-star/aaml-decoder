**Subject: Instruction for Cooling System Modification**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 13.1 (Right to Vary)**

Dear Mr. Králík,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 13.1 of the Conditions of Contract, the Employer hereby instructs the Contractor to modify the design of the cooling system for the Borduria Combined Cycle Power Plant.

This instruction is issued in response to new environmental regulations published by the Bordurian Ministry of Environment in April 2019, which impose stricter requirements on thermal discharge and water consumption for power generating facilities.

**2. BACKGROUND**

2.1 **Original Design Basis:**

The Employer's Requirements (Volume 2, Section 8.3) specified a wet mechanical draft cooling tower based on the environmental permit conditions in effect at the time of tender.

Key parameters of the original design:
- Cooling tower type: Wet mechanical draft
- Maximum thermal discharge: 5°C above ambient river temperature
- Water consumption: Approximately 2,400 m³/hour (evaporation + blowdown)

2.2 **New Regulatory Requirements:**

The Ministry of Environment Regulation No. 2019/127 "Thermal Pollution Control for Power Generating Facilities" was published on 15 April 2019 and comes into effect on 1 January 2020.

The regulation imposes the following requirements on new power plants:

| Parameter | Previous Limit | New Limit |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Thermal discharge (ΔT) | 5°C | 3°C |
| Water consumption | No specific limit | 40% reduction vs BAT baseline |
| Plume visibility | No requirement | Minimisation required |

2.3 **Impact on BCCPP:**

The BCCPP environmental permit will need to be amended to comply with the new regulations prior to commissioning. The existing wet cooling tower design cannot meet the new requirements without modification.

**3. INSTRUCTION**

3.1 The Contractor is hereby instructed to modify the cooling system design as follows:

(a) **Cooling Tower Type:** Change from wet mechanical draft to **hybrid (wet/dry) mechanical draft** cooling tower.

(b) **Thermal Discharge:** Design for maximum thermal discharge of **3°C above ambient** river temperature under all operating conditions.

(c) **Water Consumption:** Design for water consumption not exceeding **1,440 m³/hour** (40% reduction from original).

(d) **Plume Abatement:** Incorporate plume abatement features to minimise visible plume under normal operating conditions.

3.2 The revised cooling system shall:
- Maintain plant output at guaranteed levels
- Meet all performance guarantees specified in the Contract
- Comply with Regulation No. 2019/127
- Be suitable for the site conditions specified in the Employer's Requirements

**4. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS**

The revised cooling system design shall be developed in accordance with:

- CTI STD-201 (Thermal Performance)
- CTI STD-203 (Sound Level)
- Eurocode 1 (Wind and Snow Loads)
- Bordurian Building Code requirements

Specific technical requirements:

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Design wet bulb temperature | 22°C |
| Design dry bulb temperature | 35°C |
| Cooling duty | As per original specification |
| Noise level at site boundary | ≤45 dB(A) (unchanged) |
| Structural design life | 30 years |

**5. VARIATION PROCESS**

5.1 This instruction constitutes a Variation under Sub-Clause 13.1 of the Contract.

5.2 The Contractor is requested to submit a proposal for the Variation in accordance with Sub-Clause 13.3, including:

(a) Revised design documentation
(b) Impact on the Contract Price
(c) Impact on the Time for Completion
(d) Revised programme

5.3 The proposal should be submitted within **28 days** of this instruction (i.e., by 3 July 2019).

**6. INTERIM MEASURES**

6.1 Pending agreement on the Variation, the Contractor shall:

(a) Suspend procurement activities for the original cooling tower
(b) Commence preliminary design for the hybrid cooling system
(c) Engage with potential hybrid cooling tower suppliers

6.2 The Employer acknowledges that the Contractor may incur costs in relation to the suspended procurement. These costs, if substantiated, will be considered as part of the Variation evaluation.

**7. EMPLOYER'S ESTIMATE**

7.1 For budgetary purposes, the Employer has prepared a preliminary estimate of the Variation impact:

| Item | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| Additional equipment cost | EUR 12,000,000 - 15,000,000 |
| Additional civil works | EUR 1,500,000 - 2,500,000 |
| Design modification | EUR 500,000 - 800,000 |
| Programme impact | EUR 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 |
| **Total** | **EUR 15,000,000 - 20,300,000** |

7.2 This estimate is provided for information only and does not prejudice the evaluation of the Contractor's proposal.

**8. PROGRAMME IMPLICATIONS**

8.1 The Employer recognises that this Variation may affect the Time for Completion.

8.2 The Contractor is requested to provide a detailed assessment of the programme impact, including any mitigation measures that could reduce the delay.

8.3 The Employer's preliminary assessment suggests a potential impact of 60-90 days on the cooling tower construction, with consequential effects on commissioning activities.

**9. CONFIRMATION**

Please confirm receipt of this instruction and your intention to proceed with the proposal preparation within 7 days of this letter.

Yours sincerely,

**Dragan Kostić**
Technical Manager
Borduria Energy Utilities S.A.
