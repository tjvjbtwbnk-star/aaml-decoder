**Subject: Notification of Contaminated Soil Conditions - Turbine Hall Area**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 4.12 (Unforeseeable Physical Conditions)**

Dear Mr. Kostić,

**1. NOTICE**

Further to our Sub-Clause 4.12 notice dated 28 March 2019 (Reference: SPCC/BEU/2019/0009-TEC) regarding unforeseeable ground conditions, we hereby provide additional notification relating to the discovery of contaminated soil in the Turbine Hall area.

This notice supplements our previous notification and provides the detailed assessment information now available following laboratory analysis of soil samples.

**2. CONTAMINATED CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED**

2.1 During the course of additional ground investigation works conducted to delineate the extent of the artesian aquifer previously notified, the Contractor encountered soil exhibiting visual and olfactory indications of hydrocarbon contamination in boreholes BH-26, BH-27, and BH-28.

2.2 Laboratory analysis conducted by Balkan Environmental Testing Services (BETS) has confirmed the presence of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) contamination at levels significantly exceeding Bordurian regulatory limits for industrial land use.

2.3 The key findings are as follows:

| Parameter | Maximum Detected | Regulatory Limit | Exceedance |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| TPH | 4,120 mg/kg | 1,000 mg/kg | 4.1x |
| Benzene | 1.2 mg/kg | 1.0 mg/kg | 1.2x |
| PAH Total | 210 mg/kg | 100 mg/kg | 2.1x |

2.4 The contaminated zone extends across an estimated area of 3,200 m² at depths between 3.5m and 6.2m below ground level, representing approximately 5,100 m³ of contaminated soil.

**3. TECHNICAL REPORT**

A detailed Soil Contamination Assessment Report (Reference: TR-004) is enclosed with this letter. This report includes:

- Full laboratory analytical data
- Contamination extent mapping
- Risk assessment
- Historical site research findings
- Remediation options analysis
- Preliminary programme and cost impact assessment

**4. UNFORESEEABLE NATURE**

4.1 The Contractor maintains that these contaminated soil conditions were not foreseeable by an experienced contractor at the time of tender.

4.2 The Site information provided by the Employer at tender stage included a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (2017) which identified the historical fuel depot use but classified the risk as "moderate" and did not include any intrusive investigation data to confirm the presence or absence of contamination.

4.3 The Employer did not conduct a Phase 2 investigation prior to Contract award, nor did the tender documents include any allowance for contaminated soil disposal.

4.4 The contamination concentrations and extent were not ascertainable from the tender information and could only be determined through intrusive investigation.

**5. CONTRACTOR'S OBLIGATIONS**

5.1 The Contractor has taken and continues to take all measures required under Sub-Clause 4.12(b), including:

(a) Giving prompt notice of these conditions (this letter);

(b) Preparing and submitting the detailed assessment report (TR-004);

(c) Continuing other Works in unaffected areas to the extent practicable;

(d) Implementing appropriate health and safety measures.

**6. IMPACT**

6.1 The contaminated soil conditions will have a material impact on both the programme and cost of the Works.

6.2 **Programme Impact:** Foundation construction in the GT1 area cannot proceed until remediation is complete. Preliminary assessment indicates potential delays of 8-10 weeks in this area, which may affect the critical path of the Works.

6.3 **Cost Impact:** Preliminary estimate of additional costs for contaminated soil management is EUR 985,000, exclusive of delay-related costs and impacts on other work areas.

**7. REGULATORY MATTERS**

7.1 The contamination levels exceed Bordurian regulatory thresholds and notification to the Environmental Protection Agency is required.

7.2 Under the Contract (Clause 4.18), the Employer is responsible for obtaining necessary consents and approvals. We understand this includes environmental regulatory notifications.

7.3 We respectfully request that the Employer proceed with EPA notification without delay to avoid any regulatory complications.

**8. REQUEST FOR INSTRUCTIONS**

8.1 The Contractor requires instructions from the Employer/Engineer regarding the approach to remediation. Options are presented in TR-004, with our recommendation being Option A: Excavation and Off-Site Disposal.

8.2 We request that instructions be provided by **19 April 2019** to enable timely planning of remediation works and minimise programme impact.

**9. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS**

The Contractor reserves all rights under Sub-Clause 4.12, including the right to claim:

(a) Extension of Time for any delay caused by these conditions;

(b) Payment of any additional Cost incurred plus reasonable profit.

Detailed claims will be submitted in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1 once the full extent of impact can be assessed.

We remain available to meet at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter and agree the way forward.

Yours sincerely,

**Andrej Kováč**
Lead Civil Engineer
Syldavian Power Construction Consortium
