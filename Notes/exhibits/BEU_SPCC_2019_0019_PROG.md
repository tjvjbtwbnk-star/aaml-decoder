**Subject: Comments on Recovery Programme**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; SPCC/BEU/2019/0024-PROG dated 5 August 2019**

Dear Mr. Dvořák,

We refer to your submission of Recovery Programme Rev 0 dated 5 August 2019. We have now completed our review and provide the following comments.

**1. General**

1.1 We acknowledge the Contractor's efforts in preparing the Recovery Programme and the recovery measures being implemented to address the programme delays.

1.2 We note that the Recovery Programme indicates a forecast Foundation Completion date of 6 September 2019, representing a 5-day delay to the contractual milestone of 1 September 2019.

1.3 While we acknowledge the unforeseen ground conditions issue at the HRSG area (subject to our review under Sub-Clause 4.12), we have concerns regarding certain aspects of the Recovery Programme as set out below.

**2. Specific Comments**

**2.1 Recovery Measures – GT1 Area**

| Ref | Comment | Response Required |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| 2.1.1 | The night shift piling is shown as recovering 3 days, but only 2 days are documented in the supporting schedule logic. Please clarify. | Yes |
| 2.1.2 | The three-pour pile cap sequence requires confirmation that the structural design allows for the additional construction joints. | Yes |
| 2.1.3 | The high-early-strength concrete mix should be confirmed as acceptable to the Engineer. | Yes |

**2.2 Recovery Measures – HRSG Area**

| Ref | Comment | Response Required |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| 2.2.1 | The programme shows additional piling commencing 12 August. We note that VO-004 has not yet been approved. Works should not proceed without formal instruction. | Noted |
| 2.2.2 | The parallel HRSG sequence showing Pours 11-12 proceeding while Pours 8-10 are delayed requires verification that there are no technical dependencies. | Yes |
| 2.2.3 | Weekend working costs are stated as EUR 48,000. Please provide breakdown of this estimate. | Yes |

**2.3 Resource Histogram**

| Ref | Comment | Response Required |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| 2.3.1 | The histogram shows a 40% increase in BCC labour. Please confirm this has been formally committed by the subcontractor. | Yes |
| 2.3.2 | The additional supervision (4 personnel) should be named with their qualifications. | Yes |

**2.4 Risk Assessment**

| Ref | Comment | Response Required |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| 2.4.1 | The risk register does not include the risk of further unforeseen ground conditions. Given the recent discovery, this should be assessed. | Yes |
| 2.4.2 | The risk of material supply disruption is shown as "Low" probability. Given the increased demand from recovery activities, we consider this should be "Medium". | For consideration |

**2.5 Programme Logic**

| Ref | Comment | Response Required |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| 2.5.1 | Activity "GT1 Foundation Slab" shows a finish-to-start relationship with "GT1 Pile Cap Pour 3" with zero lag. Please confirm this is achievable given curing requirements. | Yes |
| 2.5.2 | The critical path analysis shows multiple near-critical paths within 2 days of the critical path. The programme appears fragile – any delay on these paths could affect the milestone. | Noted |

**3. HRSG Ground Conditions (VO-004)**

3.1 We are reviewing the Contractor's request for Variation Order VO-004 (SPCC/BEU/2019/0025-COM dated 8 August 2019).

3.2 Our preliminary view is that the conditions encountered may constitute Unforeseeable Physical Conditions under Sub-Clause 4.12. However, we require the following before we can confirm this position:

(a) Certified borehole logs from the additional investigation;
(b) Comparison analysis with the original geotechnical report;
(c) Confirmation that the Contractor's proposed solution is the most economical;
(d) Independent verification of the cost estimate.

3.3 Pending completion of our review, we are prepared to instruct the Contractor to proceed with the additional piling works on a provisional basis. A separate letter will follow.

**4. Foundation Completion Milestone**

4.1 We note the Contractor's position that the 5-day delay is wholly attributable to unforeseen ground conditions.

4.2 Without prejudice to our review of the VO-004 request, we observe that:

(a) The GT1 piling delay (recovered through acceleration) was partly attributable to Contractor productivity issues;
(b) The HRSG and Cooling Tower foundation progress was behind programme before the ground conditions issue arose;
(c) The Recovery Programme relies on several measures being successfully implemented without further problems.

4.3 We therefore reserve our position on the cause of any delay to the Foundation Completion milestone until completion is achieved and the facts can be fully assessed.

**5. Response Requirements**

5.1 Please provide responses to the comments marked "Response Required" within 7 calendar days (by 19 August 2019).

5.2 We request a revised Recovery Programme (Rev 1) incorporating responses to the above comments by the same date.

**6. Monitoring**

6.1 Given the criticality of the Foundation Completion milestone, we require enhanced progress reporting:

(a) Daily progress reports for GT1 and HRSG critical activities;
(b) Photographic record of all foundation pours;
(c) Weekly programme update (2-week look-ahead) issued each Monday.

6.2 The Employer reserves the right to increase site supervision during this critical period.

We remain committed to working with the Contractor to achieve the project milestones and look forward to receiving the revised Recovery Programme.

Yours sincerely,

**Ivana Petrović**
