# EMAIL

**From:** Sophie Dumont <s.dumont@spcc-jv.com>  
**To:** Stefan Jovanović <s.jovanovic@beu.bd>  
**Cc:** Dr. Wilhelm Braun <w.braun@spcc-jv.com>; Dragan Kostić <d.kostic@beu.bd>  
**Date:** 14 February 2019, 16:40  
**Subject:** Electrical design interface requirements

Dear Stefan,

Following up on our discussion at this week's progress meeting and as agreed at the kick-off meeting in January, I wanted to reach out to arrange our technical coordination meeting on electrical interfaces.

As you know, we're preparing Basic Design Batch 4 (Electrical and Control Systems) for submission on 25 February, and I want to make sure we have a clear understanding of all the interface requirements and BEU's expectations before we finalize the documents.

**Key Topics for Discussion:**

**1. Grid Connection Interface**
- Single line diagram configuration at the plant/grid interface
- Protection and control requirements
- Synchronization and grid code compliance
- Communication protocols with grid operator (SCADA, etc.)

I saw in Dragan's letter (BEU/SPCC/2019/0003-TEC dated 8 Feb) that you're providing the Bordurian Grid Code. Have you sent this yet? We need it to finalize our electrical design.

**2. 400 kV Switchyard Design**
- Equipment layout and spacing requirements
- Bordurian standards vs. IEC standards (any local preferences?)
- Lightning protection and earthing design basis
- Civil works interfaces (cable trenches, foundations)

**3. Generator and Transformer Specifications**
- Confirmation of generator parameters (MW rating, voltage, power factor range)
- Step-up transformer configuration (GSU transformers)
- Auxiliary transformer sizing
- Cooling requirements and interfaces

**4. Medium Voltage (11 kV) Distribution**
- MV switchgear configuration and redundancy
- Distribution to major loads (cooling water pumps, BOP loads)
- Emergency power philosophy
- Protection coordination

**5. Control System Architecture**
- Distributed Control System (DCS) scope and interfaces
- Integration with turbine control systems
- SCADA interface to BEU/grid operator
- Communication networks and cybersecurity requirements

**6. Station Auxiliary Power**
- Starting power for commissioning (you mentioned 11 kV supply - need exact location and characteristics)
- Battery systems (DC systems for control and emergency lighting)
- UPS systems for critical loads
- Diesel generators (if required - clarify if needed for black start per recent correspondence)

**7. Instrumentation and Control**
- Control room location and equipment
- I&C architecture and field instrumentation
- Safety systems and interlocks
- Interface with plant management systems

**8. Lighting and Small Power**
- Building lighting design standards
- Emergency lighting requirements
- Small power distribution
- Outdoor lighting for switchyard and plant areas

**9. Specific BEU Requirements**
I also want to understand if there are any specific BEU operational requirements or preferences for:
- Control room layout and ergonomics
- Alarm management philosophy
- Remote operation capability (if any)
- Training simulators or operator training systems
- Spare parts philosophy for electrical equipment

**10. Bordurian Standards and Regulations**
- Any specific Bordurian electrical standards that differ from IEC?
- Electrical inspection and certification requirements
- Local supply requirements (preference for local equipment where possible?)

**Proposed Meeting:**

I am available tomorrow (Friday 15 Feb) afternoon or any time Monday 18 Feb. The meeting would probably take 3-4 hours if we want to cover these topics properly. 

Would you prefer to meet at BEU offices in Szohôd or at our site office? I can bring our lead I&C engineer (Marek Beneš) if needed for the control systems discussions.

**Documents to Bring:**

I will bring:
- Preliminary single line diagrams
- Equipment list (draft)
- Control system architecture diagram (preliminary)
- Interface matrix

Could you bring:
- Bordurian Grid Code
- Any BEU operational specifications or preferences
- Starting power supply information (connection point details)
- Any existing electrical standards documents BEU uses

**Electrical Design Schedule:**

Just to give you context on our timing:
- Batch 4 submission to DPI: 25 February
- DPI review period: 21 days (to mid-March)
- Revisions if needed: late March
- Target approval: mid-April (along with other design batches)

We're working to a tight schedule, so early clarity on interfaces and requirements will really help us avoid multiple revision cycles.

I'm looking forward to working with you on this. The electrical systems are obviously critical to the plant, and I want to make sure we get everything right from the beginning.

Please let me know your availability and preference for meeting location.

Best regards,
