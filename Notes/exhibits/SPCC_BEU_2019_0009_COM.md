Dear Ms. Nikolić,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – NOTICE UNDER SUB-CLAUSE 4.12 – UNFORESEEABLE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS

In accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1 of the Contract (Contractor's Claims), SPCC hereby gives notice that we have encountered physical conditions which we consider to be Unforeseeable within the meaning of Sub-Clause 4.12 of the Contract.

This notice is issued within the 28-day period required by Sub-Clause 20.1 (notice being required within 28 days of becoming aware of the circumstances).

---

## EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE

**Nature of Event:** Discovery of unforeseeable physical ground conditions in the Gas Turbine Hall foundation area.

**Date of Discovery:** 27 March 2019 (confirmed through geotechnical investigation and laboratory testing)

**Location:** Gas Turbine Hall foundation area, specifically boreholes BH-01, BH-02, and BH-16

**Relevant Contract Provision:** Sub-Clause 4.12 states:

*"In relation to the physical conditions, if the Contractor encounters conditions which are Unforeseeable, gives a notice to the Engineer, and suffers delay and/or incurs Cost as a result of these conditions, the Contractor shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 to:*
*(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4, and*
*(b) payment of any such Cost, which shall be included in the Contract Price."*

## BACKGROUND - GEOTECHNICAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT TENDER

**Information Provided in Tender Documents:**

The Contract included the following geotechnical information in Appendix C:

1. **Preliminary Site Investigation Report (2017):**
   - 4 boreholes to 10m depth in central site area
   - Soil profile: Clay to approximately 8m, then sandy layers
   - Groundwater level: 8-9m below ground surface
   - No detailed information on deeper conditions or perched water

2. **Site Description in Tender Documents:**
   - "Generally flat site with good drainage"
   - "No known geotechnical hazards"
   - "Groundwater anticipated at approximately 8-9m based on preliminary investigation"

**Contractor's Interpretation at Tender:**

Based on the available information, SPCC reasonably expected:
- Groundwater table at approximately 8-9m depth
- Sandy/gravelly layers below the clay providing good drainage
- No significant perched water or confined aquifer conditions
- Standard dewatering requirements for excavations below groundwater level

This interpretation was consistent with the provided data and represented the normal conditions an experienced contractor would expect from such site information.

---

## UNFORESEEABLE CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED

**Discovery Through Current Ground Investigation:**

SPCC's comprehensive ground investigation (24 boreholes to depths up to 30m) has revealed conditions that differ materially from the information available at tender:

### 1. PERCHED WATER TABLE IN GT HALL AREA

**Finding:** A perched water table exists at approximately **5-6m depth** in the Gas Turbine Hall foundation area (boreholes BH-01, BH-02, BH-16), significantly shallower than the anticipated 8-9m.

**Characteristics:**
- Perched water is trapped in a sandy lens within the clay stratum
- Water level: 5.2m to 6.0m below ground surface (versus 8-9m expected)
- Significantly higher hydraulic head than main groundwater table
- Creates confined pressure conditions

**Impact:** The GT Hall foundations are planned at approximately 4.5-5.5m depth, which will intercept the perched water table. This was not anticipated based on tender information.

### 2. HIGH-PERMEABILITY SAND LENS

**Finding:** A continuous high-permeability sand lens exists at 5-8m depth in the GT Hall area, approximately 1.5-2.5m thick.

**Characteristics:**
- Hydraulic conductivity: 5 x 10⁻⁴ m/s (highly permeable)
- Continuous across GT Hall foundation footprint (~80m x 40m area)
- Saturated condition creating artesian pressure
- Not identified in preliminary 2017 investigation (boreholes too shallow and not in GT Hall location)

**Impact:** Standard wellpoint dewatering will be inadequate. Deep well dewatering system with significant pumping capacity will be required.

### 3. ARTESIAN PRESSURE CONDITIONS

**Finding:** Groundwater in the sand lens exhibits artesian pressure, rising approximately 2-3m above the static level when boreholes penetrate the layer.

**Observation:** When BH-01 penetrated the sand lens on 20 February, water rapidly rose in the borehole to approximately 3m below ground surface, indicating confined aquifer conditions. Similar behavior observed in BH-02 and BH-16.

**Impact:** Excavation into this layer without pressure relief will result in base heave, piping, and instability. Specialized dewatering and pressure relief measures required.

### 4. LABORATORY TEST RESULTS

**Consolidation Testing (completed 25 March):**
- Compression index (Cc): 0.28-0.35 (higher than typical for this soil type)
- Permeability of clay overlying sand lens: 2 x 10⁻⁸ m/s (very low - acts as confining layer)
- Time for consolidation: 6-12 months (longer than typical)

**Interpretation:** The low-permeability clay acts as a confining layer, trapping water in the underlying sand lens and creating the perched/artesian conditions. This configuration was not evident from the preliminary investigation.

---

## WHY CONDITIONS ARE "UNFORESEEABLE"

Sub-Clause 4.12 defines Unforeseeable physical conditions as those "which an experienced contractor could not reasonably have foreseen."

**These conditions are Unforeseeable because:**

### 1. Not Evident from Contract Information

- The 2017 preliminary investigation boreholes did not extend deep enough (10m) to fully characterize the sand lens at 5-8m depth in the GT Hall area
- The preliminary boreholes were not located in the GT Hall area - they were in the central site area approximately 200m away
- No information in the Contract indicated perched water or artesian conditions
- Contract description suggested normal groundwater conditions

### 2. Localized Geological Feature

- The perched water / artesian conditions appear specific to the GT Hall area
- Other areas of the site show normal groundwater conditions consistent with Contract information
- This represents a localized geological feature (confined sand lens) that could not be identified without detailed investigation in that specific area
- An experienced contractor would not have foreseen this localized feature based on the limited preliminary data

### 3. Materially Different from Contract Information

- Actual conditions (perched water at 5-6m) differ significantly from Contract information (groundwater at 8-9m)
- Artesian pressure conditions were not indicated or reasonably inferable from Contract data
- The confined aquifer behavior represents a qualitatively different condition requiring specialized measures

### 4. Reasonable Contractor's Interpretation

- SPCC's tender interpretation was reasonable and consistent with the provided information
- The preliminary investigation suggested typical soil conditions for the region
- An experienced contractor would have anticipated standard groundwater conditions based on the available data
- The actual conditions require measures (deep well dewatering, pressure relief, extended pumping) that go beyond what would be reasonably anticipated

---

## CONSEQUENCES AND IMPACTS

SPCC is conducting detailed assessment of the consequences. Preliminary evaluation indicates:

### 1. FOUNDATION DESIGN CHANGES

**Impact:** Foundation design for GT Hall must be modified to address:
- Higher groundwater level (5-6m vs. 8-9m assumed)
- Artesian pressure under foundation
- Potential for base heave during excavation
- Uplift pressure on completed foundation

**Potential Changes Required:**
- Deeper or heavier foundations to resist uplift
- Permanent pressure relief system
- Modified foundation waterproofing
- Possible change from shallow to piled foundations

**Cost Impact:** EUR 500,000 - 1,200,000 (preliminary estimate, subject to detailed design)

### 2. EXCAVATION AND DEWATERING

**Impact:** Excavation and dewatering requirements significantly more complex than anticipated:

**Standard Dewatering (Assumed at Tender):**
- Wellpoint system
- 2-3 wellpoints
- Pumping capacity: 20-30 m³/hr
- Duration: 4-6 months
- Cost: ~EUR 80,000

**Actual Requirement:**
- Deep well system with multiple wells (8-12 wells estimated)
- Pumping capacity: 100-150 m³/hr
- Pressure relief wells to prevent artesian uplift
- Extended duration: 8-12 months
- Specialist dewatering contractor required
- Continuous monitoring and control system
- Cost: ~EUR 350,000-450,000

**Additional Cost:** EUR 270,000 - 370,000

### 3. PROGRAMME IMPACT

**Time Required for Additional Works:**
- Detailed dewatering design and engineering: 3-4 weeks
- Specialist dewatering contractor procurement: 3-4 weeks
- Deep well installation: 4-6 weeks
- Pressure relief and pre-drainage: 6-8 weeks (before excavation can commence)
- Extended pumping during construction: Additional 2-4 months

**Total Programme Impact:** 12-18 weeks delay to GT Hall foundation construction

**Critical Path Impact:** GT Hall foundations are near-critical (15 days float). A delay of 12-18 weeks will consume float and may extend Time for Completion by 9-15 weeks.

**Mitigation:** SPCC will investigate acceleration measures to minimize programme impact, but some delay appears unavoidable.

### 4. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND DESIGN

**Required:**
- Detailed hydrogeological study of the sand lens (extent, connectivity, recharge sources)
- Pumping test to determine aquifer characteristics and sustainable pumping rates
- Groundwater modeling to design dewatering system
- Environmental impact assessment (discharge permits, drawdown impacts)
- Revised foundation design
- Dewatering system detailed design

**Cost:** EUR 80,000 - 120,000 for additional investigations and design work

### 5. ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERMITTING

**Discharge Permits:**
- Original environmental permit assumed standard dewatering (20-30 m³/hr discharge)
- Actual requirement (100-150 m³/hr) may require permit modification
- Additional water quality monitoring and treatment may be required
- Potential delay if permit modification needed (4-8 weeks)

**Cost:** EUR 20,000 - 40,000 for permitting and environmental compliance

### 6. POTENTIAL SCOPE CHANGES

Depending on detailed design, the following scope changes may be required:
- Change from shallow to piled foundations for GT Hall (if uplift cannot be adequately resisted)
- Permanent dewatering system (if temporary dewatering insufficient)
- Ground improvement works (if required to stabilize excavation)

These items cannot be fully quantified until detailed design is complete, but could add EUR 500,000 - 2,000,000 depending on solution required.

---

## PRELIMINARY CLAIM SUMMARY

**Estimated Additional Costs:**
- Foundation design changes: EUR 500,000 - 1,200,000
- Enhanced dewatering system: EUR 270,000 - 370,000
- Additional investigations and design: EUR 80,000 - 120,000
- Environmental/permitting: EUR 20,000 - 40,000
- **Subtotal: EUR 870,000 - 1,730,000**
- Potential scope changes: EUR 500,000 - 2,000,000 (subject to detailed design)
- **Total Estimated Range: EUR 1,370,000 - 3,730,000**

**Extension of Time:**
- Programme impact: 12-18 weeks delay to GT Hall foundations
- Critical path impact: 9-15 weeks extension to Time for Completion (subject to detailed programme analysis and mitigation measures)

**Note:** These are preliminary estimates based on initial assessment. Detailed claim particulars with full substantiation will be submitted as required by Sub-Clause 20.1.

## SPCC'S POSITION

**Sub-Clause 4.12 Entitlement:**

SPCC maintains that:

1. The encountered ground conditions (perched water table at 5-6m, confined sand lens with artesian pressure) are materially different from the Contract information (groundwater at 8-9m, no indication of perched/artesian conditions).

2. These conditions are Unforeseeable - an experienced contractor could not reasonably have foreseen them based on the preliminary investigation data provided in the Contract.

3. SPCC has suffered and will suffer delay and has incurred and will incur Cost as a direct result of these unforeseeable conditions.

4. SPCC is therefore entitled under Sub-Clause 4.12 to:
   - Extension of Time for Completion (to the extent Time for Completion is delayed)
   - Payment of additional Cost incurred

**Duty to Mitigate:**

SPCC acknowledges its duty to take all reasonable steps to minimize the delay and additional costs. We are actively:
- Engaging specialist dewatering contractors to develop most efficient solution
- Exploring foundation design alternatives to minimize additional cost
- Assessing programme acceleration measures
- Coordinating with BEU and Engineer to expedite approvals and decisions

**Good Faith:**

SPCC emphasizes that this is a genuine geotechnical discovery, not a pricing issue or contractor performance matter. The conditions were discovered through proper investigation and represent a legitimate Sub-Clause 4.12 event.

We remain committed to working collaboratively with BEU to find the most cost-effective and time-efficient solution.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

**Urgent Decisions Needed:**

1. **Dewatering Approach:** SPCC needs BEU/Engineer approval to proceed with detailed dewatering design and specialist contractor procurement. Delay in this approval will extend programme impact.

2. **Foundation Design Approach:** BEU input needed on acceptable foundation alternatives (deeper foundations, piles, ground improvement, etc.) to guide design.

3. **Environmental Permit:** Confirm process and timeline for modifying discharge permit if required.

4. **Programme:** Agreement needed on programme baseline for assessing delay (taking into account any prior delays or extensions).

**SPCC Immediate Actions:**

1. Detailed hydrogeological assessment (underway, completion 10 April)
2. Dewatering system design (commence immediately, completion 25 April)
3. Foundation design alternatives evaluation (commence 5 April, completion 20 April)
4. Specialist contractor procurement (commence 1 April)
5. Detailed claim particulars preparation (submission target 30 April)
