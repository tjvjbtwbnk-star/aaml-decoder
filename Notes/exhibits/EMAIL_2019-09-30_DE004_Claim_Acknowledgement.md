---

Dear Jiří,

I acknowledge receipt of the Contractor's detailed claim submission dated 27 September 2019 (SPCC/BEU/2019/0030-COM) in respect of Delay Event DE-004 (Grid Connection Data).

**1. Claim Summary**

The Contractor claims:
- Extension of Time: 18 calendar days
- Additional Cost: EUR 127,500

**2. Employer's Position**

As previously communicated (BEU/SPCC/2019/0021-COM dated 26 August 2019), the Employer does not accept that the Contractor has any entitlement in respect of this matter. Our position remains that:

(a) The provision of TSO data is the Contractor's responsibility under the Contract
(b) The Employer's assistance was voluntary and does not create liability
(c) The Contractor's notice was time-barred under Sub-Clause 20.1

**3. Review Process**

Notwithstanding the above, the detailed claim will be reviewed and a substantive response provided within 42 days (by 8 November 2019) in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5.

The Engineer (DPI) has been copied on this correspondence and will be requested to make a determination in due course.

**4. Senior Commercial Meeting**

I note that we have a senior commercial meeting scheduled for 7 October 2019. DE-004 will be one of the agenda items for discussion.

Please ensure that all supporting documentation referenced in the claim is made available for the meeting.

Regards,
