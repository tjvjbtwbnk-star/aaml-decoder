# TECHNICAL REPORT

| | |
|---|---|
| **Report No.:** | TR-007 |
| **Title:** | Programme Analysis – Critical Path Assessment |
| **Date:** | 23 July 2019 |
| **Prepared by:** | Martin Dvořák, Planning Manager, SPCC |
| **Reviewed by:** | Miroslav Horák, Project Manager, SPCC |
| **Project:** | Borduria Combined Cycle Power Plant |

## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents an analysis of the current programme status with particular focus on the critical path to the Foundation Completion milestone (1 September 2019). The analysis identifies that the GT1 foundation sequence is critical and that the milestone is at risk without recovery measures. Recommendations are provided for programme recovery.

**Key Findings:**
- Foundation Completion milestone forecast: 2 September 2019 (1 day late)
- Critical path: GT1 bored piling → GT1 pile cap → GT1 foundation slab
- Float consumed: 15 days reduced to 0 days on critical path
- Recovery potential: 3-5 days through identified measures

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Purpose

### 2.2 Scope

The report covers:
- Current programme status analysis
- Critical path identification
- Delay causation analysis
- Recovery options assessment
- Recommendations

## 3. Background

### 3.1 Contractual Milestones

| Milestone | Contractual Date | Current Forecast | Variance |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| Basic Design Approval | 15 Apr 2019 | 12 Jun 2019 | +58 days (Achieved) |
| Foundation Completion | 1 Sep 2019 | 2 Sep 2019 | +1 day (Forecast) |
| GT1 Delivery to Site | 1 Mar 2020 | 1 Mar 2020 | 0 days |
| Taking Over | 14 Jan 2023 | TBD* | TBD |

*Subject to DE-002 and DE-003 EOT claims

### 3.2 Programme Recovery History

Following the Basic Design Approval delay, SPCC implemented acceleration measures in Q2 2019:
- Additional civil works resources mobilised
- Parallel piling operations in non-GT1 areas
- Extended working hours

These measures successfully recovered the programme by end-June 2019, restoring SPI to 1.00 and 15 days float.

### 3.3 Current Situation

The GT1 bored piling operation has encountered slower-than-planned productivity due to:
- Harder founding stratum than anticipated in some pile locations
- Initial mobilisation and calibration period for specialist equipment
- Hot weather affecting concrete curing (requiring additional precautions)

This has resulted in erosion of the recovered float.

## 4. Current Programme Status

### 4.1 Overall Progress

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Schedule Performance Index (SPI) | 0.97 | Declining ↓ |
| Float on Critical Path | 0 days | Reduced from 15 days |
| Float on Near-Critical Paths | 5-8 days | Stable |
| Overall Physical Progress | 18.2% | On track |

### 4.2 Civil Works Progress Detail

**GT1 Bored Piling:**

| Parameter | Planned | Actual | Variance |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|
| Piles complete (as of 22 July) | 20 | 18 | -2 |
| Productivity (piles/day) | 1.5 | 1.3 | -0.2 |
| Completion date | 26 Jul | 30 Jul | +4 days |

**Foundation Pours:**

| Area | Planned Complete | Actual Complete | Variance |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Admin Building | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| HRSG Area | 55% (6.6 pours) | 50% (6 pours) | -5% |
| Cooling Tower | 45% (3.6 pours) | 38% (3 pours) | -7% |

### 4.3 Critical Path Analysis

The current critical path is:

```
GT1 Piling (remaining) → GT1 Pile Cap Pour 1 → GT1 Pile Cap Pour 2 → 
GT1 Foundation Slab → Foundation Completion Milestone
```

**Critical Path Timeline:**

| Activity | Duration | Start | Finish |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| GT1 Piling (remaining 10 piles) | 8 days | 23 Jul | 30 Jul |
| Pile cap preparation | 4 days | 31 Jul | 3 Aug |
| GT1 Pile Cap Pour 1 | 1 day | 5 Aug | 5 Aug |
| Curing and preparation | 5 days | 6 Aug | 10 Aug |
| GT1 Pile Cap Pour 2 | 1 day | 12 Aug | 12 Aug |
| Curing and preparation | 5 days | 13 Aug | 17 Aug |
| GT1 Foundation Slab | 1 day | 19 Aug | 19 Aug |
| Curing to completion | 14 days | 20 Aug | 2 Sep |
| **Milestone** | | | **2 Sep** |

This shows a 1-day overrun against the 1 September milestone.

## 5. Delay Causation Analysis

### 5.1 GT1 Piling Delay (4 days)

| Cause | Days | Category |
|-------|------|----------|
| Harder founding stratum (GP-08, GP-12, GP-15) | 2.0 | Ground conditions |
| Equipment mobilisation/calibration | 1.0 | Contractor performance |
| Hot weather concrete precautions | 0.5 | Weather |
| Minor mechanical breakdowns | 0.5 | Contractor performance |
| **Total** | **4.0** | |

**Assessment:** Approximately 50% of the delay (2 days) is attributable to ground conditions which may support a claim under Sub-Clause 4.12. The remaining 50% is Contractor risk.

### 5.2 HRSG Foundation Delay

| Cause | Impact | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Rebar delivery delay (Batch 8) | 1 day | Subcontractor |
| BCC productivity below plan | 2 days | Subcontractor |
| Hot weather pour restrictions | 0.5 days | Weather |

**Assessment:** HRSG foundations are not currently critical. Float of 8 days exists before this path becomes critical.

### 5.3 Cooling Tower Foundation Delay

| Cause | Impact | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Design hold (DE-003) | 2 days | Employer variation |
| BCC resource allocation priority | 1 day | Contractor management |

**Assessment:** Cooling Tower foundations are not currently critical. Float of 12 days exists.

## 6. Recovery Options Analysis

### 6.1 Option 1: Accelerated GT1 Piling

**Description:** Add night shift to piling operation

| Parameter | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Productivity increase | +0.5 piles/day |
| Duration saving | 2 days |
| Additional cost | EUR 45,000 |
| Risk | Moderate (quality control in darkness) |

**Recommendation:** Implement

### 6.2 Option 2: Parallel Pile Cap Construction

**Description:** Split pile cap into three pours instead of two, allowing earlier start

| Parameter | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Duration saving | 2 days |
| Additional cost | EUR 15,000 (additional joints) |
| Risk | Low |

**Recommendation:** Implement

### 6.3 Option 3: Reduced Curing Period

**Description:** Use high-early-strength concrete to reduce curing period

| Parameter | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Duration saving | 2-3 days |
| Additional cost | EUR 8,000 |
| Risk | Low (proven methodology) |

**Recommendation:** Implement

### 6.4 Option 4: Weekend Working

**Description:** Work weekends on critical GT1 activities

| Parameter | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Duration saving | 2-4 days |
| Additional cost | EUR 65,000 (premium rates) |
| Risk | Low |

**Recommendation:** Reserve as contingency

### 6.5 Combined Recovery Potential

| Option | Days Recovered | Cost (EUR) |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Option 1 (Night shift piling) | 2 | 45,000 |
| Option 2 (Parallel pile cap) | 2 | 15,000 |
| Option 3 (High-early concrete) | 2 | 8,000 |
| **Total (Options 1-3)** | **6** | **68,000** |
| Option 4 (if required) | +2-4 | +65,000 |

**Net Position:** Implementation of Options 1-3 would recover 6 days against the 4-day delay, providing 2 days contingency. The milestone could be achieved by 30 August 2019.

## 7. Conclusions

7.1 The Foundation Completion milestone (1 September 2019) is currently forecast to be achieved 1 day late (2 September 2019).

7.2 The critical path runs through the GT1 piling and foundation sequence.

7.3 The delay is caused by a combination of ground conditions (50%) and Contractor performance factors (50%).

7.4 Recovery is achievable through implementation of identified acceleration measures at an estimated cost of EUR 68,000.

7.5 With recovery measures, the milestone can be achieved by 30 August 2019, providing 2 days contingency.

## 8. Recommendations

8.1 **Immediate Actions:**
- Implement night shift on GT1 piling (Option 1) – effective 24 July
- Confirm three-pour pile cap sequence with structural engineer (Option 2)
- Order high-early-strength concrete for pile cap pours (Option 3)

8.2 **Contingency:**
- Reserve weekend working (Option 4) for implementation if further delays occur

8.3 **Monitoring:**
- Daily reporting on GT1 piling to continue
- Weekly critical path review until milestone achieved

8.4 **Commercial:**
- Prepare notice under Sub-Clause 4.12 for ground condition delays (2 days)
- Advise Employer that recovery costs may form part of future claim

8.5 **Recovery Programme:**
- Formal Recovery Programme submission may be appropriate if Employer requests under Sub-Clause 8.3
