Further to your Technical Report TR-004 dated 8 April 2019, the Technical Coordination Meeting held on 12 April 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency inspection on 18 April 2019, and subsequent discussions, we hereby issue instructions for the management of contaminated soil in the Turbine Hall area.

**2. EPA APPROVAL**

The Bordurian Environmental Protection Agency has reviewed the proposed remediation approach and has issued approval (Reference: EPA/BCCPP/2019/0012 dated 23 April 2019). A copy is attached for your records.

**3. INSTRUCTION**

The Contractor is hereby instructed to proceed with contaminated soil remediation in accordance with the following specification:

**3.1 Remediation Approach**

The remediation shall be undertaken using the "Excavation and Off-Site Disposal" approach (Option A as presented in TR-004).

**3.2 Contaminated Zone Definition**

The contaminated zone shall be defined as:

(a) All soil within the 1,000 mg/kg TPH contour as established by the ground investigation; plus

(b) A 2-metre lateral buffer beyond the 1,000 mg/kg contour; plus

(c) Vertical extent from 3.0m below existing ground level to 0.5m below the lowest detected contamination (approximately 6.7m below existing ground level).

The contaminated zone boundary is shown on the attached drawing BEU-BCCPP-SK-001.

**3.3 Excavation Requirements**

(a) All soil within the defined contaminated zone shall be excavated and removed from site.

(b) Excavation shall be undertaken in controlled lifts not exceeding 0.5m depth.

(c) The excavation shall be kept dry at all times using appropriate dewatering measures.

(d) Verification sampling shall be undertaken at the base and sides of the excavation at a frequency of 1 sample per 100 m² to confirm that residual contamination is below 1,000 mg/kg TPH.

(e) If verification sampling identifies contamination exceeding 1,000 mg/kg, additional excavation shall be undertaken until compliant results are achieved.

**3.4 Groundwater Management**

(a) Groundwater from the excavation shall be collected, treated, and disposed of in accordance with Bordurian environmental regulations.

(b) A temporary discharge permit shall be obtained from Szohôd Water Authority prior to any discharge.

(c) Treated water shall achieve the following quality standards before discharge:
   - TPH: < 5 mg/L
   - Benzene: < 0.01 mg/L
   - Suspended solids: < 50 mg/L

(d) Continuous monitoring of discharge water quality shall be undertaken with records maintained.

**3.5 Air Monitoring**

(a) Continuous air monitoring shall be undertaken during excavation works using photoionisation detector (PID) equipment.

(b) Action levels:
   - 5 ppm: Increase ventilation, review controls
   - 25 ppm: Stop work, evacuate, implement emergency procedures

(c) All personnel working in the excavation shall wear appropriate PPE including respiratory protection as determined by the risk assessment.

**3.6 Disposal**

**3.7 Backfill**

(a) The excavation shall be backfilled with certified clean engineered fill meeting the following requirements:
   - Classification: Well-graded granular material (GP-GM or similar)
   - Maximum particle size: 75mm
   - Compaction: 95% Modified Proctor
   - TPH: < 100 mg/kg (certification required)

(b) Backfill placement shall be in layers not exceeding 300mm loose thickness.

(c) Compaction testing shall be undertaken at a frequency of 1 test per 500 m³.

**3.8 Environmental Monitoring**

(a) Groundwater monitoring wells (minimum 3 no.) shall be installed around the remediated area.

(b) Baseline groundwater sampling shall be undertaken prior to remediation commencement.

(c) Post-remediation groundwater monitoring shall be undertaken monthly for 6 months.

**4. PROGRAMME**

4.1 The Contractor shall submit a detailed remediation programme within 7 days of this instruction.

4.2 Remediation works shall commence within 14 days of approval of the remediation methodology.

4.3 The Employer's target for completion of remediation (excluding post-remediation monitoring) is 8 weeks from commencement.

**5. METHODOLOGY SUBMISSION**

The Contractor shall submit a detailed Remediation Methodology for approval, including:

(a) Method statement for excavation works
(b) Dewatering system design and calculations
(c) Groundwater treatment system design
(d) Health and safety risk assessment
(e) Emergency response procedures
(f) Detailed programme
(g) Resource schedule
(h) Quality control and verification plan

This submission shall be made within 7 days of this instruction.

**6. COMMERCIAL MATTERS**
