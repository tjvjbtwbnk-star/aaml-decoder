Dear Dr. Vladić,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT DATE

I refer to the Contract for the above-referenced Project dated 15 November 2018, which became effective on 1 January 2019.

On behalf of Syldavian Power Construction Consortium, I am pleased to formally confirm that the Commencement Date pursuant to Sub-Clause 8.1 of the Contract is **15 January 2019**.

In accordance with the Contract requirements, SPCC hereby confirms its readiness to commence all activities necessary for the successful execution of the Works. Our mobilisation activities are progressing as planned, and we anticipate receiving possession of the Site in accordance with Sub-Clause 2.1 on or about 1 February 2019.

Key personnel have been appointed and notified to your team, and our Project Management Team is now operational. We look forward to working collaboratively with BEU and the Engineer to deliver this important project for Borduria.

A formal kick-off meeting is proposed for the week of 21 January 2019 to review mobilisation plans, establish communication protocols, and confirm the programme baseline. Our Project Manager, Mr. Miroslav Horák, will be in contact with your office to arrange the specific date and agenda.

Please do not hesitate to contact me or Mr. Horák should you require any further information or clarification.
