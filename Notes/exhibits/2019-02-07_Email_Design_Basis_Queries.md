**To:** Dragan Kostić <d.kostic@beu.bd>

**Subject:** Process design basis clarification request

Dear Dragan,

I am writing to request clarification on several items in the Employer's Requirements that affect our process design basis, which we submitted in Batch 1 on 24 January. These queries have arisen during our detailed design development and need to be resolved to ensure we proceed on the correct basis.

**1. Fuel Gas Composition - Seasonal Variation**

The Contract Specification (Section 2.3.1) provides a representative fuel gas composition from the Bordurian National Grid. However, it does not specify the expected seasonal or long-term variation in gas properties.

Our questions:
- What is the expected range of Higher Heating Value (HHV)? We have assumed 39.5 ± 1.0 MJ/Nm³ - is this reasonable?
- Does the gas composition vary significantly between summer and winter supply sources?
- What is the expected range of Wobbe Index variation?
- Are there any plans for the grid operator to introduce LNG or other alternative gas sources that would affect composition?

This information is critical for gas turbine combustion system design and performance guarantee test conditions.

**2. Ambient Temperature - Performance Test Conditions**

The Employer's Requirements specify:
- Design ambient temperature: 30°C (for sizing purposes)
- Performance guarantee test conditions: To be conducted at site conditions

However, Sub-Clause 9.1 of the particular conditions states that performance tests shall be conducted "between 1 March and 30 November" without specifying the exact temperature conditions for guarantee verification.

Our questions:
- Should we assume performance tests will be conducted at actual ambient conditions prevailing during the test, with corrections applied per ISO 2314?
- Is there a target ambient temperature range for scheduling the performance tests (e.g., 15-25°C)?
- What is the acceptable tolerance for ambient conditions during performance testing?

This affects how we calculate and present the guaranteed performance values.

**3. Cooling Water - River Vlaja Supply**

The design basis assumes cooling water makeup from River Vlaja with the following parameters (from Appendix D):
- Flow rate availability: 150 m³/hr minimum
- Temperature range: 4°C (winter) to 22°C (summer)
- Water quality: Moderate hardness, low suspended solids

Our questions:
- Are there any seasonal restrictions on water abstraction (e.g., during low flow periods)?
- What is the minimum river flow rate, and has the 150 m³/hr abstraction been confirmed as acceptable to environmental authorities?
- Is water treatment required before use as cooling tower makeup, or can river water be used directly?
- Who is responsible for abstraction infrastructure from river to plant battery limits?

This is important for cooling system design and performance modeling.

**4. Grid Connection - Voltage and Frequency Stability**

The electrical single-line diagram in the Employer's Requirements shows connection to the 400 kV Szohôd North Substation. 

Our questions:
- What is the short-circuit level at the point of connection?
- What are the expected voltage variations (± %) under normal operation?
- What is the grid frequency stability (Hz ± Hz)?
- Are there any grid code requirements we must be aware of (reactive power capability, voltage ride-through, etc.)?

This information is needed for generator and electrical system design.

**5. Starting Power Supply**

During commissioning and startup, before the plant can generate its own power, we will need external power supply.

Our questions:
- Will BEU provide a temporary construction power supply adequate for commissioning (estimated 2-3 MW)?
- If yes, what voltage level and where is the connection point?
- If no, should SPCC plan for mobile generators or other temporary power arrangements?

This has commercial implications (cost and schedule) depending on who provides this supply.

**6. Natural Gas Pipeline - Pressure and Availability**

The Contract states natural gas supply pipeline is "by others under separate contract" with completion scheduled for June 2022.

Our questions:
- What will be the gas delivery pressure at plant battery limits? (Our design assumes 40 barg)
- Will gas be available for commissioning of individual gas turbines (September-October 2022), or only upon full pipeline completion?
- Is there a commissioning gas supply specification (minimum purity requirements, pressure stability)?
- Who is responsible for fiscal metering - BEU or gas utility?

This affects our gas compression station design and commissioning planning.

**7. Black Start Capability**

The technical specification mentions "black start capability" but does not provide detailed requirements.

Our questions:
- Is black start capability from the 400 kV grid required, or from the plant itself?
- If from the plant, what is the required time to achieve islanded operation?
- What is the minimum load the plant must be able to pick up during black start?
- Are there specific diesel generators or battery systems required for black start?

This could significantly affect electrical system design and cost.

I realize this is quite a long list of queries, but these are genuine design basis issues that we need to resolve early. Many of these affect equipment specifications that are already in procurement or approaching critical decision points.

**Proposed Approach:**

I suggest we schedule a technical coordination meeting next week to discuss these items. This would be more efficient than exchanging multiple emails. I am available any day next week except Wednesday morning (weekly progress meeting).

Could you please review these questions with your team and let me know your availability for a meeting? I estimate we would need 2-3 hours to work through these items properly.

Alternatively, if you prefer, we can prepare a formal Request for Information (RFI) document with these queries, though I think a meeting would be more productive initially.

Thank you for your attention to these matters. I appreciate that some of these questions may require you to consult with other parties (grid operator, gas utility, etc.), but early resolution is important for our schedule.

Best regards,
