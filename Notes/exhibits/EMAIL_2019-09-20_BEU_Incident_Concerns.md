---

Dear Miroslav,

Thank you for the prompt notification regarding the lifting incident of 18 September (SPCC/BEU/2019/0029-HSE).

While we acknowledge that the injuries were minor and that SPCC has responded appropriately, the Employer has significant concerns about this incident.

**1. Loss of Zero LTI Record**

This is the project's first recordable incident after 420,000 man-hours worked. While technically not a Lost Time Incident, it is a Medical Treatment Case and represents a deterioration in safety performance. More importantly, it could easily have been far more serious.

**2. Root Cause Concerns**

The root causes identified are deeply concerning:

- **Failure to follow lift plan:** This indicates a breakdown in the safety management system. Lift plans exist precisely to prevent this type of incident.

- **Inadequate supervision:** The appointed competent person was absent. This is unacceptable for a critical lift operation.

- **Exclusion zone breach:** Workers entering the exclusion zone during a lift is a fundamental safety rule violation.

All three root causes point to systemic issues, not individual error.

**3. Subcontractor Performance**

We note that both the crane operator (BCC) and the injured workers (BCC) are from the same subcontractor. This is the same subcontractor whose productivity and resource issues have been a recurring theme throughout Q3.

We request that SPCC provide:

(a) A comprehensive review of BCC's safety management competence
(b) Confirmation that BCC supervisors have adequate training and certification
(c) Details of any previous safety observations or concerns relating to BCC

**4. Steel Erection Operations**

The incident occurred during structural steel erection, which is now ramping up significantly. We are concerned that if safety standards are not rigorously maintained, further incidents will occur.

We request that SPCC:

(a) Provide the full steel erection safety plan for BEU review
(b) Arrange for BEU observers to be present during critical lifts
(c) Implement the "stop work" authority for BEU site representatives where safety concerns are observed

**5. Safety Meeting**

Given the significance of this incident, we request that the upcoming Safety Committee Meeting (SCM-001 scheduled for 18 September – which I understand was postponed due to this incident) be convened as soon as possible to review this incident in detail.

Please respond to the above by **25 September 2019**.

Best regards,
