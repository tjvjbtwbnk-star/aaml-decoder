## 5. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

### 5.1 Soil Stratigraphy

Based on 18 completed boreholes, a consistent soil profile has been identified across the main plant area:

**STRATUM 1: TOPSOIL (0 - 0.5m depth)**
- Description: Silty topsoil with organic content
- Color: Dark brown
- Consistency: Loose
- Notes: To be stripped and stockpiled for landscaping

**STRATUM 2: SANDY CLAY (0.5 - 12m depth)**
- Description: Medium to stiff sandy clay with occasional silt layers
- Color: Light brown to reddish brown
- Plasticity: Medium (PI = 15-25)
- SPT N-values: 8-25 blows/300mm (average ~15)
- Notes: Principal bearing stratum for shallow foundations

**STRATUM 3: SILTY SAND TRANSITION (12 - 15m depth)**
- Description: Silty fine sand with clay lenses
- Color: Brown to gray
- Density: Medium dense
- SPT N-values: 15-30 blows/300mm
- Notes: Transition layer

**STRATUM 4: GRAVELLY SAND (15m+ depth)**
- Description: Medium to coarse sand with gravel
- Color: Gray
- Density: Medium dense to dense
- SPT N-values: 25-50+ blows/300mm
- Notes: Excellent bearing stratum for piled foundations if required

**BEDROCK:** Not encountered within investigation depths (maximum 30.5m). Regional data suggests bedrock at >50m depth.

### 5.2 Groundwater Conditions

**Groundwater Table:** Encountered at 8.0m to 10.0m below existing ground surface (approximately elevation 156-158m above sea level).

**Observations:**
- Relatively consistent depth across site
- Free-draining in sandy layers
- Slightly artesian pressure observed in some deeper sand layers (minor upward flow)

**Seasonal Variation:** Long-term monitoring required to assess seasonal fluctuations. BGS advises typical variation of ±1-2m in this region.

**Water Quality:** Samples taken for chemical analysis. Results pending.

### 5.3 Standard Penetration Test Results

SPT N-values by stratum:

| Stratum | Depth Range (m) | N-value Range | Average N-value | Classification |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Topsoil | 0-0.5 | 2-5 | 3 | Very Loose |
| Sandy Clay | 0.5-12 | 8-25 | 15 | Medium Stiff |
| Transition | 12-15 | 15-30 | 22 | Medium Dense |
| Gravelly Sand | 15+ | 25-50+ | 35 | Dense |

**Interpretation:** SPT results indicate adequate bearing capacity for conventional foundations. Sandy clay stratum (Stratum 2) shows medium stiffness suitable for shallow foundations with proper design. Gravelly sand (Stratum 4) provides excellent support for piled foundations if required.

## 6. PRELIMINARY GEOTECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

### 6.1 Foundation Type Options

Based on preliminary findings, the following foundation options are feasible:

**OPTION 1: Shallow Foundations (Spread Footings or Mat)**

**Suitable for:** Buildings and equipment with moderate loading (e.g., administration building, electrical building, some mechanical equipment)

**Bearing Stratum:** Sandy clay (Stratum 2)

**Preliminary Allowable Bearing Pressure:** 150-200 kPa (based on SPT correlations, subject to confirmation from laboratory tests and settlement analysis)

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost
- Simpler construction
- Faster execution

**Considerations:**
- Settlement must be evaluated (consolidation tests in progress)
- Groundwater level is within foundation zone - dewatering required for excavations >8m
- Foundation depth typically 2-4m below grade

**OPTION 2: Piled Foundations**

**Suitable for:** Heavy structures and equipment (e.g., gas turbine hall, HRSGs, steam turbine, cooling towers)

**Bearing Stratum:** Gravelly sand (Stratum 4) at ~15m depth

**Preliminary Pile Capacity:** 
- Driven piles (300mm diameter): 500-800 kN per pile
- Bored piles (600mm diameter): 1000-1500 kN per pile
- (Subject to detailed design and pile load testing)

**Advantages:**
- Higher capacity
- Lower settlement
- Better performance for heavy dynamic loads (turbines)

**Considerations:**
- Higher cost
- Requires specialist pile contractor
- Longer construction duration

**Recommendation:** Combined foundation system is likely optimal:
- Piled foundations for main power block structures (GT Hall, ST Hall, HRSGs, cooling towers)
- Shallow foundations for lighter buildings and equipment

### 6.2 Settlement Considerations

**Preliminary Assessment:**

**Sandy Clay (Stratum 2):**
- Medium plasticity, medium stiffness
- Consolidation characteristics: To be determined from oedometer tests
- Expected settlement: 25-50mm for typical building loads (preliminary estimate)
- Settlement timeframe: Months to years (clay consolidation)

**Concern:** Differential settlement between adjacent structures must be carefully evaluated. Piled foundations may be preferred for critical structures to minimize settlement.

**Gravelly Sand (Stratum 4):**
- Dense, free-draining
- Expected settlement: Immediate (elastic) settlement only, <20mm
- No consolidation settlement in sand

**Recommendation:** Final foundation design must include comprehensive settlement analysis. Acceptable settlement criteria to be defined (typically 25mm total, 15mm differential for machinery foundations).

### 6.3 Groundwater Management

**Excavation Dewatering:**

Excavations deeper than 8-9m will encounter groundwater. Dewatering will be required for:
- Piled foundation construction (pile caps typically 2-3m below grade, but excavation for pile installation)
- Deep utility trenches
- Basement areas (if any)

**Dewatering Method:** Wellpoint or deep well system likely required depending on excavation depth and permeability.

**Discharge:** Dewatering discharge must be managed in accordance with environmental permit. Sedimentation and treatment may be required before discharge to drainage system or River Vlaja.

**Permanent Drainage:** Foundation drainage system required to manage groundwater infiltration. Perimeter drains and sumps recommended for structures below groundwater level.

### 6.4 Excavation Stability

**Sandy Clay:**
- Can be excavated with conventional equipment
- Temporary excavation slopes: 1H:1V (45°) to 1.5H:1V recommended with short-term stability
- Deep excavations (>4m) will require shoring or battering to prevent collapse
- Excavation stability analysis required for final design

**Groundwater Impact:**
- Water ingress will reduce excavation stability
- Dewatering essential for excavations below water table
- Risk of base heave in clay layers if excavation extends well below water table

**Recommendation:** Excavation support system (sheet piling, soldier piles, or battered slopes with dewatering) required for deep excavations.

### 6.5 Geotechnical Risks

**No Major Risks Identified to Date:**

- No evidence of contamination
- No evidence of collapsible soils
- No evidence of organic deposits or peat
- No evidence of old foundations or buried structures
- No evidence of karst features or subsidence
- No evidence of high sulfate or chloride requiring special concrete protection

**Minor Risks:**

1. **Groundwater:** Dewatering required for deeper excavations. Impact on schedule and cost must be assessed.

2. **Settlement:** Consolidation settlement in clay must be evaluated. May require piled foundations for critical structures.

3. **NE Area Unknown:** 6 boreholes remain in NE area (not yet drilled). Soil conditions assumed similar but must be confirmed.

## 8. CONCLUSIONS

Based on 18 of 24 boreholes completed (75% of investigation):

1. **Soil conditions are generally favorable** for power plant construction. No unforeseeable conditions or major geotechnical hazards have been identified.

2. **Soil profile is relatively uniform** across the main plant area, consisting of sandy clay (suitable for shallow foundations) overlying gravelly sand (suitable for piled foundations).

3. **Groundwater table at 8-10m depth** will require dewatering for deeper excavations but does not present a major obstacle.

4. **Combined foundation system** (piles for heavy structures, shallow foundations for lighter structures) is likely optimal and cost-effective.

5. **No significant geotechnical risks** have been identified that would affect project feasibility, schedule, or cost.

6. **NE area boreholes** (remaining 6) are needed to confirm consistency of conditions across the entire site, but no significant variations are anticipated.

7. **Investigation is ahead of schedule** and on track for completion 7 March, supporting foundation design approval by mid-April.

---

## 9. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Complete remaining boreholes** in NE area as scheduled (28 Feb - 5 March).

2. **Expedite laboratory testing** to support timely completion of geotechnical report (12 April target).

3. **Initiate preliminary foundation design** based on these findings, to be finalized upon receipt of complete geotechnical report.

4. **Plan for excavation dewatering** in construction programme and budget.

5. **Monitor groundwater levels** over coming weeks to establish design groundwater level.

6. **No major changes to project assumptions** are required based on these preliminary findings.
