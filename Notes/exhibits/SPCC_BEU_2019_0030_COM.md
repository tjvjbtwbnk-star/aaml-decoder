**Subject: Delay Event DE-004 – Detailed Claim Submission (Grid Connection Data)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clauses 1.9 and 20.1; SPCC/BEU/2019/0027-COM dated 22 August 2019**

Dear Mrs. Nikolić,

Further to our notice dated 22 August 2019, we hereby submit this detailed claim in respect of Delay Event DE-004 concerning the late provision of grid connection data.

**1. Executive Summary**

The Contractor claims entitlement to:

| Item | Claim |
|------|-------|
| Extension of Time | 18 calendar days |
| Additional Cost | EUR 127,500 |
| Total | 18 days + EUR 127,500 |

**2. Factual Background**

2.1 **Contract Requirements**

The Contract requires the Contractor to design the electrical systems for the Works, including protection, power quality, and control system interfaces with the Transmission System Operator (TSO).

2.2 **Data Requirements**

To complete the detailed electrical design, the following data from the TSO is essential:

- Grid fault level at 400kV connection point
- Grid impedance characteristics (positive, negative, zero sequence)
- System frequency variation data
- Grid voltage profile (normal operating range)
- Protection coordination requirements

2.3 **Request for Data**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 15 Mar 2019 | SPCC formal request to BEU for TSO data |
| 28 Mar 2019 | BEU acknowledged and confirmed liaison with TSO |
| 15 Apr 2019 | BEU advised expected delivery "early June" |
| 14 Jun 2019 | SPCC enquiry – BEU advised "slight delay, expected end June" |
| 30 Jun 2019 | Data not received |
| 15 Jul 2019 | SPCC follow-up – BEU advised "TSO delayed, chasing" |
| 1 Aug 2019 | Data not received |
| 15 Aug 2019 | BEU letter advising data expected by 30 August |
| 22 Aug 2019 | SPCC notice under Sub-Clause 1.9 |
| 26 Aug 2019 | **Data received** |

2.4 **Delay Period**

| Expected | Actual | Delay |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 15 June 2019 | 26 August 2019 | **72 calendar days** |

**3. Contractual Basis**

3.1 **Sub-Clause 1.9 – Delayed Drawings or Instructions**

Sub-Clause 1.9 provides that the Employer shall give notice to the Contractor of "any information... which is necessary for the execution of the Works... within a time which gives the Contractor reasonable time to perform his obligations."

If the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost as a result, the Contractor is entitled to Extension of Time under Sub-Clause 8.4 and payment of Cost plus reasonable profit.

3.2 **Application to Grid Data**

The grid connection data is "information necessary for the execution of the Works" because:

(a) It is essential for protection system design – cannot be assumed
(b) It is essential for power quality equipment sizing
(c) It is required for control system interface specification
(d) Without it, detailed electrical design cannot be completed

3.3 **Employer's Responsibilities**

The Contract Data (Part A) identifies "Grid Connection Agreement" as an Employer-provided document. The TSO data forms part of the grid connection interface information that the Employer is obligated to provide.

**4. Employer's Position – Rebuttal**

The Employer, in its letter BEU/SPCC/2019/0021-COM dated 26 August 2019, rejected the Contractor's claim on the following grounds. We address each:

**4.1 "Grid data is not Drawings or Instructions"**

The Contractor does not accept this narrow interpretation. Sub-Clause 1.9 refers to "any Drawings, any instructions or any other information." The grid data is clearly "other information" necessary for the Works.

**4.2 "Contractor design responsibility under Sub-Clause 5.1"**

The Contractor accepts responsibility for design. However, this does not extend to creating or assuming data that only the TSO can provide. The Contractor cannot design protection systems based on guesswork.

**4.3 "Employer's Requirements Section 3.4.2"**

The cited section states that the Contractor shall be responsible for "all interfaces with the TSO." This means coordinating the design, not obtaining fundamental grid parameters. The distinction between interface coordination (Contractor) and data provision (Employer/TSO) is clear.

**4.4 "Time-barred under Sub-Clause 20.1"**

The notice was given on 22 August 2019, within 28 days of 26 August 2019 when data was received. The claim event is the failure to provide data by the expected date. The Contractor gave notice promptly when it became clear that the delay was causing material impact.

**5. Delay Analysis**

5.1 **Impact on Design**

The detailed electrical design was programmed at 25% complete by 30 June 2019. Without grid data, progress was limited to elements not dependent on TSO parameters.

| Element | % of Electrical | Status Without Data |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protection system | 15% | On hold |
| Power quality | 5% | On hold |
| Control interfaces | 8% | On hold |
| Other electrical | 72% | Could proceed |
| **Total Affected** | **28%** | |

5.2 **Measured Delay**

| Activity | Planned Completion | Actual Completion | Delay |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Electrical detailed design | 30 Sep 2019 | 18 Oct 2019* | 18 days |

*Current forecast

5.3 **Critical Path Impact**

The electrical design is on the critical path for:
- Procurement of protection relays
- GT control software finalisation
- Main switchgear design freeze

The 18-day delay to electrical design completion has the following downstream impacts:

| Activity | Original | Revised | Impact |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| Protection relay procurement | 15 Oct 2019 | 2 Nov 2019 | 18 days |
| GT control software | 31 Aug 2019 | 18 Sep 2019 | 18 days |

5.4 **Mitigation**

The Contractor has mitigated the delay through:
- Additional design resources (2 engineers assigned 15 August)
- Extended design office hours
- Parallel working on non-dependent elements
- Rapid incorporation of TSO data upon receipt

Without mitigation, the delay would have been approximately 30 days.

**6. Cost Claim**

| Item | Calculation | Amount (EUR) |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Design team standing time** | | |
| - 2 electrical engineers × 6 weeks × EUR 2,500/week | 2 × 6 × 2,500 | 30,000 |
| - 1 protection specialist × 4 weeks × EUR 3,500/week | 1 × 4 × 3,500 | 14,000 |
| **Extended design office overhead** | 6 weeks × EUR 4,000/week | 24,000 |
| **Additional design resources (mitigation)** | 2 engineers × 6 weeks × EUR 2,500/week | 30,000 |
| **TurboMach delay costs** | Provisional – GT software delay | 15,000 |
| **Sub-total Direct Costs** | | 113,000 |
| **Reasonable profit (8%)** | 113,000 × 8% | 9,040 |
| **Preliminaries extension** | 18 days (not claimed – absorbed) | 0 |
| **Rounding** | | 5,460 |
| **Total Claim** | | **127,500** |

**7. Summary of Claim**

| Item | Claim |

| Extension of Time | **18 calendar days** |
| Cost | **EUR 127,500** |

| 3 | Delay analysis (time impact assessment) |
| 4 | Resource deployment records |
| 5 | Cost substantiation and calculations |
| 6 | TurboMach correspondence regarding GT software |
| 7 | Technical memorandum – grid data necessity |

**9. Request**

9.1 The Contractor requests that the Engineer determine that the Contractor is entitled to:

(a) Extension of Time: 18 calendar days
(b) Additional Cost: EUR 127,500

9.2 We request a meeting to discuss this claim at the Employer's earliest convenience.
