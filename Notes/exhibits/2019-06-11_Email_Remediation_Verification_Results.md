Dear Ivana,

I am pleased to report that the verification sampling conducted yesterday and today has confirmed successful remediation of the contaminated soil in the GT1 area.

**Verification Sampling Results:**

Maria Santos witnessed the sampling on 10-11 June. BETS Environmental Laboratory conducted the analysis on an expedited basis.

| Sample ID | Location | Depth (m) | TPH (mg/kg) | Limit (mg/kg) | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| VS-01 | NW corner | 6.5 | 245 | 1,000 | PASS |
| VS-02 | NE corner | 6.7 | 312 | 1,000 | PASS |
| VS-03 | SE corner | 6.4 | 189 | 1,000 | PASS |
| VS-04 | SW corner | 6.6 | 278 | 1,000 | PASS |
| VS-05 | Centre | 6.5 | 156 | 1,000 | PASS |
| VS-06 | Centre-N | 6.5 | 223 | 1,000 | PASS |
| VS-07 | Centre-S | 6.6 | 198 | 1,000 | PASS |
| VS-08 | Centre-E | 6.4 | 267 | 1,000 | PASS |
| VS-09 | Centre-W | 6.5 | 234 | 1,000 | PASS |

**All samples are well below the regulatory limit of 1,000 mg/kg TPH.**

The highest reading (312 mg/kg at VS-02) is less than one-third of the limit, providing good confidence in the remediation effectiveness.

**Excavation Summary:**

| Parameter | Planned | Actual |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Volume excavated | 5,400 m³ | 5,620 m³ |
| Material disposed | 8,100 tonnes | 8,430 tonnes |
| Duration | 4 weeks | 3.5 weeks |

The slightly higher volume reflects the conservative approach taken at the boundaries of the contaminated zone.

**Next Steps:**

1. Formal verification report from BETS: Expected 13 June
2. EnviroClean demobilisation: Commencing 12 June
3. Backfilling commencement: 13 June
4. Backfilling completion: 24 June (target)
5. GT1 pile working platform ready: 26 June

**Programme Impact:**

The remediation is completing 4 days ahead of the target date of 28 June. This provides some recovery of the overall ground conditions delay, though the majority of the impact (foundation redesign, extended piling) remains.

**DE-002 Claim:**

We are finalising the DE-002 claim documentation and will submit by 21 June as planned. The verification sampling results and final quantities will be included.

I would like to thank Dragan and his team for the constructive approach to managing this challenging situation, and Maria for her diligent oversight of the verification process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
