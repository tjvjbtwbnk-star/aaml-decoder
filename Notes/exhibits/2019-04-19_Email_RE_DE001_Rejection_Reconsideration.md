Dear Ana,

Thank you for your letter BEU/SPCC/2019/0008-COM dated 18 April 2019 responding to our EOT claim for delayed Site access (DE-001).

We have reviewed the Employer's position carefully and, with respect, we do not accept the rejection of our claim. I am writing to request reconsideration of this matter and to provide clarification on several points.

**Critical Path Analysis:**

Your letter states that our Time Impact Analysis does not demonstrate the NE area works are on the critical path. With respect, this mischaracterises our submission.

Our claim is not that the NE area works themselves are on the critical path, but rather that:

1. The delay to ground investigation boreholes BH-17 and BH-18 created a gap in the geotechnical data set;

2. This gap prevented finalisation of the drainage design for the overall Site, which relies on understanding groundwater conditions across the full Site area;

3. The drainage design is a predecessor to foundation design approval (as reflected in our programme logic);

4. Foundation design approval is on the critical path.

This knock-on effect is what creates the critical path impact, not the NE area works in isolation.

**Ground Investigation:**

Your letter suggests that only 2 boreholes were affected. However, you will note from our submission that boreholes BH-17 through BH-24 were all located in or accessed through the NE area. The access restriction affected 8 boreholes, not 2. This represents one-third of the investigation programme.

Furthermore, the delay to these boreholes meant that the ground investigation campaign could not be completed as a single mobilisation. The drilling subcontractor (BGS) demobilised on 8 March and had to be remobilised in early April to complete the NE area boreholes. This remobilisation itself caused additional delay and cost.

**Mitigation:**

Your letter suggests we did not implement re-sequencing or mitigation measures. This is not accurate. We would draw your attention to:

1. We re-sequenced borehole drilling to maximise progress in accessible areas;
2. We commenced earthworks in the Admin Building area ahead of programme to utilise available resources;
3. We brought forward design activities where possible to reduce the net impact.

Without these mitigation measures, the impact would have been significantly greater than 45 days. The 45-day claim already accounts for mitigation - it is not a simple 60-day pass-through.

**Contractual Position:**

Sub-Clause 2.1 is clear that the Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of, all parts of the Site within the time stated. The Employer did not fulfil this obligation. Under Sub-Clause 8.4(b), the Contractor is entitled to extension of time for delay caused by a matter giving entitlement under a Sub-Clause of the Conditions.

The question is not whether the NE area itself is on the critical path, but whether the failure to provide Site access caused or contributed to delay to the Works. We maintain that it did.

**Request:**

Given the points above, we respectfully request that the Employer reconsider its position. We believe a fair assessment of the evidence supports an entitlement to Extension of Time, even if there may be scope for discussion on the quantum.

We propose a meeting to discuss this matter in more detail, perhaps in the week following Easter. We are confident that a collaborative review of the programme logic and impacts would demonstrate the validity of our position.

In the meantime, we reserve all our rights under the Contract and will consider referral to the Engineer if this matter cannot be resolved between the parties.

I am available to discuss at your convenience.

Best regards,
