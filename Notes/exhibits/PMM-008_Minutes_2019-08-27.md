### 2. Executive Summary – Project Status

M. Horák presented the executive summary:

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | PMM-007 | PMM-008 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Overall Progress | 18.5% | 21.8% | +3.3% |
| Design Progress | 38% | 45% | +7% |
| Construction Progress | 22% | 28% | +6% |
| SPI | 0.99 | 0.96 | -0.03 |
| Safety (TRIR) | 0.42 | 0.38 | -0.04 ↓ |

**Key Achievements:**
- Cooling Tower foundations 100% complete (21 August)
- VO-003 (Cooling System) – Variation Order signed
- VO-004 (Additional Piling) – Agreement reached
- HRSG additional piling complete (25 August)
- Grid connection data received (26 August)
- First structural steel delivery received (19 August)

**Key Concerns:**
- Foundation Completion milestone forecast 6-7 days late
- BCC productivity below plan (improving)
- DE-004 (Grid Data) claim disputed

Dr. Vladić acknowledged the progress but expressed concern about the Foundation Completion milestone delay. He stated that BEU expects the Contractor to take all measures to minimise the delay.

### 3. Safety Performance

P. Horváth (report delivered by P. Novotný):

**Statistics (August to date):**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Man-hours worked | 62,400 |
| LTIs | 0 |
| TRIR | 0.38 |
| Near-misses | 3 |

No significant safety incidents. Near-miss rate increasing slightly due to accelerated activity – being monitored.

### 4. Design Progress

Dr. Braun presented:

**Overall Design Status:**

| Package | PMM-007 | PMM-008 | Progress |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Civil/Structural | 52% | 62% | +10% |
| Mechanical | 34% | 42% | +8% |
| Electrical/I&C | 27% | 35% | +8% |
| Cooling System | 5% | 22% | +17% |
| **Overall** | **38%** | **45%** | **+7%** |

**Key Points:**
- Structural design consent received from DPI (23 August)
- Cooling system design accelerating following VO-003
- Grid data received 26 August – electrical design can now progress
- Target for detailed design completion: 15 October 2019 (revised from 30 September)

D. Kostić (BEU) enquired about the revised completion date. Dr. Braun explained that the cooling system design (VO-003) and grid data delay have impacted the overall programme.

Dr. Vladić noted that this represents a 15-day slip and asked whether this impacts Taking Over. Dr. Braun confirmed it does not directly impact Taking Over as the current float absorbs this delay, but it reduces contingency.

### 5. Construction Progress

P. Novotný presented:

**5.1 GT1 Foundation**
- Pile cap: 100% complete (final pour 22 August)
- Foundation slab: Pour scheduled 28 August (tomorrow)
- Forecast completion: 1 September (originally) → 5 September (current)

**5.2 HRSG Foundations**
- Pours 1-7: Complete
- Pours 8-10: Redesigned – Pour 8 scheduled 30 August
- Pours 11-12: Complete
- Forecast completion: 7 September

**5.3 Cooling Tower**
- 100% complete (21 August)

**5.4 Overall Foundation Status**

| Area | Complete | Target |
|------|----------|--------|
| GT1 | 85% | 100% by 5 Sep |
| HRSG | 75% | 100% by 7 Sep |
| Cooling Tower | 100% | Complete ✓ |
| Admin Building | 100% | Complete ✓ |

**5.5 Structural Steel**
- Admin Building steel erection commenced 26 August
- First columns erected – erection progressing at 2 bays/day

### 6. Programme Status – Foundation Completion

M. Dvořák presented the critical milestone status:

**Foundation Completion Milestone: 1 September 2019 (Contract)**

| Forecast | Date | Delay |
|----------|------|-------|
| Recovery Rev 0 (5 Aug) | 6 Sep | +5 days |
| Recovery Rev 1 (19 Aug) | 5 Sep | +4 days |
| Current (27 Aug) | 7 Sep | +6 days |

**Delay Attribution:**

| Cause | Days | Category |
|-------|------|----------|
| HRSG unforeseen ground conditions | 5 | VO-004 (Employer) |
| GT1 piling ground conditions | 2 | DE-002 (Mixed) |
| BCC productivity shortfall | 2 | Contractor |
| Recovery measures achieved | (3) | Mitigation |
| **Net Delay** | **6** | |

I. Petrović (BEU) stated that BEU's position is:
- 5 days accepted under VO-004 (unforeseen ground conditions)
- 1 day is Contractor-caused delay
- BEU reserves its rights regarding delay damages for Contractor-caused delay

T. Králík (SPCC) stated that SPCC's position is that all delay is attributable to Employer risk events and no Contractor-caused delay exists. The GT1 piling conditions were unforeseeable.

Dr. Weber (DPI) noted that the determination of delay attribution will be made by the Engineer once the facts are established.
