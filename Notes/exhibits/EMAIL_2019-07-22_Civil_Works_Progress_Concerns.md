Dear Miroslav,

I hope you had a restful weekend. I am writing to express the Employer's growing concerns regarding civil works progress, which I would like to discuss at our meeting on Thursday (PMM-007).

Having reviewed the weekly progress reports and Branko's site observations, I note the following:

**1. GT1 Piling**

While I understand there have been some ground condition challenges, the current position is:

- Original completion target: 26 July 2019
- Current forecast: 28-30 July 2019
- Piles complete as of Friday: 17 of 28 (61%)
- Remaining: 11 piles in 6-8 working days

This represents a 2-4 day slip on a critical path activity. While you have indicated this can be absorbed, I am concerned about the lack of contingency should any further issues arise.

**2. Foundation Progress**

| Area | % Complete | Programme Target |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Admin Building | 100% | 100% ✓ |
| HRSG Area | 50% | 55% |
| Cooling Tower | 38% | 45% |
| GT1 Area | 0% | 0% (awaiting piling) |

The HRSG and Cooling Tower areas are both behind programme. Branko reports that BCC resource levels appear adequate but productivity is lower than planned.

**3. Foundation Completion Milestone**

The contractual Foundation Completion milestone is 1 September 2019. Based on current progress:

- GT1 foundation is now the critical path
- Current forecast shows completion on 2 September (1 day late)
- No float remains on this milestone

I must remind you that this is a Key Date under the Contract with associated consequences for late completion.

**4. Questions for SPCC**

Please be prepared to address the following at PMM-007:

1. What specific measures are being taken to recover the GT1 piling programme?
2. What is the root cause of the HRSG and Cooling Tower foundation delays?
3. What recovery actions are proposed?
4. Does SPCC require a formal Recovery Programme under Sub-Clause 8.3?
5. What is SPCC's confirmed position on achieving the 1 September milestone?

I appreciate that the project has faced challenges (ground conditions, cooling system change) and we have worked constructively to address these. However, I am concerned that the cumulative effect of various delays is eroding programme contingency and placing key milestones at risk.

I look forward to a frank discussion on Thursday.

Best regards,
