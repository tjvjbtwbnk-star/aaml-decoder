**Subject: Revised Foundation Design Approach - GT1 Turbine Hall**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; TCM-002 Minutes dated 29 April 2019**

Dear Mr. Kostić,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

Further to the Technical Coordination Meeting No. 2 (TCM-002) held on 29 April 2019 and our email correspondence of 9 May 2019, we hereby formally submit the revised foundation design approach for the GT1 Turbine Hall.

This submission documents the agreed change from the original driven pile design to a deep bored pile solution, necessitated by the unforeseeable ground conditions encountered.

**2. BACKGROUND**

2.1 The original GT1 foundation design was based on the geotechnical information available at tender stage, which indicated founding conditions in medium dense sand at depths of 8-10m below ground level.

2.2 The ground investigation conducted in March 2019, together with the subsequent discovery of a perched artesian aquifer and contaminated soil conditions, has revealed that:

(a) The originally assumed founding stratum is located within the contaminated zone;

(b) An artesian aquifer exists between approximately 5-6m and 12m depth;

(c) Suitable founding conditions (dense sand with N>50) exist at depths of 30-35m.

2.3 These conditions preclude the use of the original driven pile solution and necessitate a redesign.

**3. DESIGN ALTERNATIVES EVALUATED**

At TCM-002, three alternative foundation solutions were presented and evaluated:

| Option | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Deep bored piles | Proven technology; certain outcome; no long-term obligations | Higher cost; longer programme |
| 2 | Ground improvement | Lower capital cost | Unproven in these conditions; regulatory uncertainty |
| 3 | Raft with permanent dewatering | Shallower founding | Ongoing operational cost; reliability concerns |

**Decision:** Option 1 (Deep Bored Piles) was selected as the preferred solution by consensus of all parties.

**4. REVISED DESIGN BASIS**

The revised GT1 foundation design is based on the following parameters:

**4.1 Pile Design:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Pile Type | Bored cast-in-situ, reinforced concrete |
| Pile Diameter | 750mm |
| Pile Length | 28-32m (variable based on ground conditions) |
| Number of Piles | 28 |
| Design Capacity (ULS) | 4,500 kN per pile |
| Concrete Grade | C40/50 |
| Reinforcement | 1.5% minimum |

**4.2 Pile Cap:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Plan Dimensions | 18m x 24m |
| Thickness | 2.5m |
| Concrete Volume | 820 m³ |
| Concrete Grade | C35/45 |
| Reinforcement | Approx. 120 tonnes |

**4.3 Installation Method:**

(a) Bored piles to be installed using CFA (Continuous Flight Auger) or rotary boring method, depending on ground conditions encountered.

(b) Temporary casing through contaminated zone and aquifer to prevent cross-contamination.

(c) Pile installation to follow completion of contamination remediation and backfilling.

(d) Pile integrity testing (100%) and static load testing (5%) to be performed.

**5. COORDINATION WITH REMEDIATION**

5.1 The remediation excavation will remove contaminated soil to approximately 6.7m depth, creating a working platform for pile installation.

5.2 The excavation will be backfilled with certified clean engineered fill to pile cut-off level (approximately 3.0m below finished ground level).

5.3 Groundwater control measures will be maintained from remediation through pile installation.

5.4 Sequence: Remediation → Backfill → Pile Installation → Pile Cap Construction

**6. PROGRAMME**

6.1 The revised GT1 foundation programme is as follows:

| Activity | Duration | Start | Finish |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| Remediation | 7 weeks | 15 May 2019 | 30 Jun 2019 |
| Backfilling | 2 weeks | 24 Jun 2019 | 5 Jul 2019 |
| Piling mobilisation | 1 week | 1 Jul 2019 | 5 Jul 2019 |
| Pile installation | 4 weeks | 8 Jul 2019 | 2 Aug 2019 |
| Pile curing and testing | 2 weeks | 5 Aug 2019 | 16 Aug 2019 |
| Pile cap construction | 4 weeks | 19 Aug 2019 | 13 Sep 2019 |
| **GT1 Foundation Complete** | | | **15 Sep 2019** |

6.2 The original programme showed GT1 foundation completion on 15 July 2019.

6.3 The revised completion date of 15 September 2019 represents a delay of **62 days** attributable to the ground conditions.

**7. COST IMPACT**

7.1 A detailed cost comparison is being prepared for submission with the DE-002 claim.

7.2 Preliminary estimate of additional foundation cost: EUR 850,000 - 1,100,000.

7.3 This is additional to the contamination remediation costs previously notified.

**8. DESIGN SUBMISSION PROGRAMME**

| Document | Target Submission |
|----------|-------------------|
| Preliminary pile layout (for information) | 17 May 2019 |
| Structural design calculations | 24 May 2019 |
| Foundation drawings (IFC) | 31 May 2019 |
| Pile working platform design | 17 May 2019 |
| Specification and method statement | 24 May 2019 |

**9. REQUEST FOR COMMENTS**

We request any comments or requirements from the Employer regarding this revised design approach by **24 May 2019** to enable timely completion of detailed design.

In particular, we request confirmation of:

(a) Acceptance of the deep bored pile solution;
(b) Any specific requirements for pile testing or monitoring;
(c) Any operational requirements affecting foundation design (e.g., future equipment access).

**10. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS**

This submission is made without prejudice to the Contractor's entitlements under Sub-Clause 4.12 arising from the unforeseeable ground conditions. A comprehensive claim for Extension of Time and additional costs will be submitted in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.

Yours sincerely,

**Andrej Kováč**
