Dear Tomáš,

Thank you for the constructive discussion this afternoon. I found it valuable to have a candid exchange at senior level, away from the day-to-day project pressures.

I wanted to confirm my understanding of what we agreed:

**1. Overall Relationship:**

We both acknowledged that while there are commercial disagreements, the working relationship at project level remains professional and collaborative. The success of the Design Task Force demonstrates this. We agreed to maintain this spirit as we enter the more intensive construction phase.

**2. Claims Resolution Approach:**

We agreed to pursue a "rolling settlement" approach to open claims rather than allowing them to accumulate:

- **DE-001 (Site Access):** EOT resolved (20 days). Cost claim to be expedited - target resolution by end of July.

- **DE-002 (Ground Conditions):** SPCC to submit claim by 21 June. BEU/DPI to evaluate promptly. Target preliminary response within 28 days.

- **DE-003 (Cooling System):** SPCC to submit Variation proposal by 3 July. BEU to treat as priority for evaluation. This is the largest open item and requires focused attention.

**3. Commercial Framework:**

We agreed in principle that:

- Employer-caused delays entitle SPCC to EOT and cost recovery
- Contractor-caused delays are SPCC's responsibility
- Mixed-cause delays require fair apportionment
- Neither party will use claims strategically to gain advantage

**4. Acceleration:**

We discussed the possibility of acceleration to recover programme time. We agreed that:

- SPCC's current recovery measures are at its own cost (mitigation of Contractor delays)
- Any acceleration beyond mitigation, if requested by BEU, would be compensated
- The feasibility and cost of acceleration will be assessed if/when the programme position becomes clearer following DE-002 and DE-003 resolution

**5. Quarterly Senior Reviews:**

We agreed to establish quarterly senior reviews (you, me, Heinrich) to maintain oversight of commercial matters and relationship health. These would supplement the monthly PMMs.

First quarterly review: Week of 16 September 2019 (after Q3 close)

**6. Communication:**

We agreed that our project managers (Ivana and Miroslav) are empowered to resolve day-to-day matters and should only escalate to us when genuinely necessary. We will avoid micromanaging.

**Next Steps:**

- I will brief Ivana and Ana on our discussion
- Please brief Miroslav and Jiří accordingly
- Heinrich is copied for his awareness

I believe this meeting was valuable and hope it sets a positive tone for the coming months. BEU remains committed to the success of BCCPP and to a fair commercial relationship with SPCC.

Please let me know if I have mischaracterised anything from our discussion.

Best regards,
