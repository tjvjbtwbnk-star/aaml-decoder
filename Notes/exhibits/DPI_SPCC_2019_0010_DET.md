**Subject: Engineer's Determination – Foundation Completion Delay Attribution**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clauses 3.5, 8.4, and 8.7**

Dear Mr. Procházka,

Further to the Foundation Completion Certificate issued on 9 September 2019 (ref: DPI/SPCC/2019/0009-CERT), I hereby issue this determination regarding the attribution of the 6-day delay to the Foundation Completion milestone.

**1. Background**

1.1 The contractual date for Foundation Completion was 1 September 2019.

1.2 Foundation Completion was certified as achieved on 7 September 2019.

1.3 The delay to this milestone is therefore 6 calendar days.

1.4 Both Parties have made submissions regarding the cause of this delay:
- SPCC position: All delay attributable to Employer risk events
- BEU position: 5 days Employer risk; 1 day Contractor-caused

**2. Analysis**

I have reviewed the following documents in making this determination:

- Recovery Programme Rev 0 (5 August 2019)
- Recovery Programme Rev 1 (19 August 2019)
- Weekly Progress Meeting minutes WPM-019 to WPM-026
- Technical Report TR-008 (Geotechnical Report)
- Daily progress reports
- BCC productivity reports
- Programme analysis from both Parties

**2.1 HRSG Unforeseen Ground Conditions (VO-004)**

The discovery of soft organic clay at HRSG Grid Lines H4-H6 on 2 August 2019 has been accepted as an Unforeseeable Physical Condition under Sub-Clause 4.12. The Variation Order VO-004 has been agreed at EUR 195,000 and 5 days Extension of Time.

**Critical Path Analysis:**

The HRSG foundation works were on the critical path at the time of discovery. The additional piling works (6 piles) took 14 calendar days (12-25 August 2019). However, through parallel working and redesign, the net delay was limited to 5 days.

**Determination:** 5 days of delay are attributable to the HRSG unforeseen ground conditions and are covered by VO-004.

**2.2 GT1 Foundation Works**

The Contractor's Recovery Programme identified the GT1 foundation works as the original source of programme concern, with delays arising from:

(a) Harder than expected ground conditions during piling (completed 5 days late)
(b) Pile cap formwork complexity (Pour 3 delayed by 5 days)

**Analysis:**

(a) **GT1 Piling:** The piling delays were partially addressed through recovery measures (night shift, additional resources). The Contractor has claimed that the ground conditions were unforeseeable. However, the conditions encountered (harder rock requiring more drilling time) are within the range of normal variability for bored piling operations. The original geotechnical data indicated variable ground conditions. An experienced contractor should have anticipated some variability in piling productivity.

(b) **Pile Cap Formwork:** The delay to Pour 3 was attributed to "complexity of edge shuttering." This is a design and construction issue within the Contractor's control. While BCC productivity was also a factor, BCC is the Contractor's subcontractor and its performance is the Contractor's responsibility under Sub-Clause 4.4.

**Recovery Measures:**

The Contractor implemented recovery measures (night shift, high-early concrete, three-pour sequence) which recovered approximately 5 days. The net effect of the GT1 issues after recovery is approximately 2 days of delay.

However, these 2 days of delay were absorbed by the programme such that the HRSG works became critical. The concurrent nature of the delays must be considered.

**2.3 Concurrent Delay Analysis**

Applying the principle of concurrent delay:

| Period | GT1 Status | HRSG Status | Critical Path |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-22 Jul | Piling in progress | On track | GT1 |
| 22-31 Jul | Piling complete | On track | GT1 |
| 1-5 Aug | Pile cap in progress | On track | GT1 |
| 5-12 Aug | Pile cap delayed | Ground conditions discovered | HRSG |
| 12-25 Aug | Recovery ongoing | Additional piling | HRSG |
| 25 Aug-7 Sep | Complete | Completing | HRSG |

The HRSG unforeseen ground conditions became critical on 5 August 2019. From this date, the Contractor delays on GT1 were no longer on the critical path.

**3. Determination**

Based on my analysis, I determine that the 6-day delay to Foundation Completion is attributed as follows:

| Cause | Days | Attribution | Contractual Basis |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| HRSG Unforeseen Ground Conditions | 5 | Employer Risk | Sub-Clause 4.12 / VO-004 |
| Contractor Performance (GT1/BCC) | 1 | Contractor Risk | Sub-Clause 8.1 |
| **Total** | **6** | | |

**4. Consequences**

**4.1 Extension of Time**

The Contractor is entitled to 5 days Extension of Time for the Foundation Completion milestone under VO-004. This has already been agreed and incorporated into the Contract.

**4.2 Delay Damages**

Under Sub-Clause 8.7 and the Contract Data, delay damages are applicable for Contractor-caused delay to milestones.

The Contract Data specifies milestone delay damages of **EUR 25,000 per day** for Foundation Completion.

For the 1 day of Contractor-caused delay:
- Delay Damages = 1 day × EUR 25,000 = **EUR 25,000**

The Employer is entitled to deduct this amount from payments due to the Contractor.

**5. Contractor's Right to Dispute**

5.1 This determination is made under Sub-Clause 3.5 of the Conditions of Contract.

5.2 If the Contractor is dissatisfied with this determination, the Contractor may give notice of dissatisfaction under Sub-Clause 3.5 within 28 days of receiving this determination.

5.3 If no notice of dissatisfaction is given within 28 days, this determination shall become final and binding.

**6. Notification**

This determination is issued to both Parties in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Heinrich Weber**
