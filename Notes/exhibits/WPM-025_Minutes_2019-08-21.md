### 1. Review of Previous Minutes and Actions

The minutes of WPM-024 dated 14 August 2019 were approved without amendment.

| Action | Description | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| WPM-024/01 | Scaffold incident investigation to BEU | P. Horváth | Closed |
| WPM-024/02 | Implement pre-pour checklist sign-off | O. Malý | Closed |

### 2. Safety Report

P. Horváth reported:

- No lost time incidents during the week
- Total man-hours worked: 15,600
- Near-misses: None reported
- Scaffold incident investigation completed – root cause identified as inadequate board securing during relocation. Corrective action: mandatory board clips on all working platforms.
- Heat stress: Temperatures now consistently below 30°C – reduced incidents

I. Petrović (BEU) acknowledged the scaffold investigation findings.

### 3. BCC Performance Discussion (Special Item)

M. Horák introduced the item and welcomed Mr. Đurić (BCC General Manager) to discuss the concerns raised in Mrs. Petrović's email of 20 August.

**3.1 Resource Status**

N. Đurić presented the current BCC resource position:

| Date | Personnel | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 19 Aug | 112 | Monday start of week |
| 20 Aug | 118 | Improvement |
| 21 Aug (today) | 122 | On track for target |

N. Đurić acknowledged the shortfall in previous weeks and explained:
- Labour market in Borduria is competitive with other infrastructure projects
- Some workers left for higher-paying projects
- Recruitment drive underway – 8 new workers started this week
- Target of 125 personnel achievable by Monday 26 August

**3.2 Productivity Discussion**

G. Stanković addressed the productivity concerns:

**Formwork:** Current rate 52 m²/day vs target 65 m²/day
- Cause: GT1 pile cap formwork is complex geometry requiring more time
- Action: Additional experienced carpenters assigned; expecting 58-60 m²/day by next week

**Rebar:** Current rate 9 t/day vs target 12 t/day
- Cause: Crane coordination issues – waiting time for lifts
- Action: Dedicated crane time allocated 06:00-10:00 daily for rebar; expecting 11 t/day

I. Petrović (BEU) stated that the explanations are noted but results must improve. She emphasised that the Foundation Completion milestone is a contractual requirement and BCC's underperformance is putting it at risk.

N. Đurić committed to achieving:
- 125 personnel by 26 August
- Formwork rate: 60 m²/day by 28 August
- Rebar rate: 11 t/day by 28 August

**Action:** N. Đurić to provide weekly productivity improvement report.

M. Horák confirmed that SPCC will continue to monitor BCC performance closely and will take contractual action if improvement is not achieved.

### 4. Construction Progress

### 5. HRSG Additional Piling Update

### 6. Programme Update

M. Dvořák presented the programme status:

**Recovery Programme Rev 1 Status:**

| Measure | Planned | Achieved | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Extended night shift | 2 days | 2 days | Complete |
| Sunday working | 1 day | 1 day | Complete |
| Additional crane | 1 day | 0.5 day | Partial |
| **Total Recovery** | **4 days** | **3.5 days** | |

**Current Forecast:**

| Milestone | Target | Forecast | Variance |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|

| HRSG Complete | - | 7 Sep | - |
| CT Complete | - | 21 Aug | Complete ✓ |
| **Foundation Completion** | **1 Sep** | **7 Sep** | **+6 days** |

I. Petrović (BEU) noted with concern that the forecast has slipped by a further day from the 5 September in Recovery Programme Rev 1. She requested an explanation.

M. Dvořák explained that the additional crane recovery has been less effective than planned due to operator availability. SPCC is addressing this.

### 7. Commercial Matters

J. Procházka reported:

**7.1 VO-004 (Additional Piling)**
- BEU/DPI review complete
- Agreement reached: EUR 195,000 / 5 days EOT
- Variation Order being prepared

**7.2 DE-004 (Grid Connection Data)**
- Formal notice under Sub-Clause 1.9 to be submitted tomorrow (22 August)

- Certification expected by end of month

K. Hoffmann (DPI) confirmed VO-004 evaluation is complete and the figures are agreed.

### 8. Quality Update

O. Malý reported:

- No NCRs raised during the week
- GT1 Pile Cap Pour 3: Cube tests at 3-day show 42 MPa (excellent for high-early)
- HRSG additional piles: All cube tests compliant
- Pre-pour checklist system implemented – first use on Pour 11 was successful

M. Todorović (BEU) confirmed she observed the new checklist process and is satisfied with the implementation.

### 9. Any Other Business

**9.1 Structural Steel**
First structural steel delivery (Admin Building) received 19 August. Erection to commence 26 August. Steel erection team mobilising.

D. Kostić (BEU) reported that the TSO has now committed to providing the data by 28 August (2 days earlier than previously indicated). BEU will transmit immediately upon receipt.

**9.3 PMM-008**
Confirmed for Tuesday 27 August at 14:00.

**9.4 Foundation Completion Milestone**
I. Petrović summarised BEU's position:
- Milestone is 1 September 2019
- Current forecast is 7 September – 6 days late
- Of this, 5 days may be attributed to unforeseen ground conditions (VO-004) – subject to formal agreement
- The remaining 1 day appears to be Contractor-caused delay
- BEU reserves its position on delay damages pending completion
