Tomáš,

Following receipt of BEU's position letter yesterday (BEU/SPCC/2019/0017-COM), I have completed my analysis and wanted to share my thoughts before our internal strategy meeting on Monday.

**Summary of BEU Position**

| Item | Our Claim | BEU Offer | Gap |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Cost | EUR 22.3M | EUR 17.45M | EUR 4.85M (22%) |
| Time | 85 days | 45 days | 40 days (47%) |

**My Assessment**

**1. Cost**

The EUR 4.85M gap breaks down as follows:

| Item | Gap (EUR) | Recoverable? | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Cooling tower supply | 1,250,000 | Partial | BEU is wrong on scope split - we can demonstrate with CoolTech data |
| Design development | 730,000 | Unlikely | Our rates and contingency are justified but hard to prove prospectively |
| Civil works | 1,150,000 | Partial | Contingency reduction is unfair at this stage |
| Piping | 650,000 | Likely | Minor - can demonstrate with detailed estimates |
| Electrical | 270,000 | Likely | Minor - can demonstrate |
| Prolongation | 800,000 | Depends on time | Linked to EOT determination |

Realistic recovery estimate: EUR 2.0-2.5M of the EUR 4.85M gap, giving a settlement range of EUR 19.5-20.0M.

**2. Time**

This is the more concerning gap. BEU's 45-day assessment significantly underestimates the true impact:

- They have not properly understood the design dependencies
- Their "parallelisation" argument ignores the sequential nature of process design
- The foreseeability argument is weak but introduces uncertainty

Key weaknesses in our position:
- We don't have a fully resourced delay analysis (yet)
- Mitigation measures could have been more clearly documented
- The 85-day claim includes some conservative assumptions

Realistic recovery estimate: 60-70 days EOT (vs our 85-day claim)

**3. The Foreseeability Issue**

I am concerned about BEU's paragraph 5.2 which hints at foreseeability arguments. While they have not pursued this fully (wisely, in my view), it suggests they may use this as leverage in negotiations.

Our counter-arguments:
- The specific regulation (No. 2019/127) was not enacted until March 2019
- General awareness of tightening regulations does not equate to specific foreseeability
- The Contract baseline was a wet cooling tower approved during tender
- Risk allocation under FIDIC is clear - this is a Change in Law variation

However, if this goes to dispute, there is some risk here.

**4. Commercial Strategy - Options**

**Option A: Accept the offer (EUR 17.45M / 45 days)**
- Pros: Quick resolution, allows CoolTech order, maintains relationship
- Cons: Significant value erosion (EUR 4.85M + 40 days)
- My view: Not recommended

**Option B: Counter at EUR 20.5M / 70 days**
- Pros: Maintains strong position, room to negotiate
- Cons: May extend negotiations, programme risk
- My view: Preferred approach

**Option C: Full rejection and formal dispute**
- Pros: Protects full entitlement claim
- Cons: Relationship damage, significant time/cost of dispute
- My view: Not recommended at this stage

**5. Negotiation Leverage**

Our leverage:
- CoolTech order timing is critical - BEU needs this resolved
- Our claim is well-documented
- We have the moral high ground (Employer-mandated change)

BEU's leverage:
- Programme pressure on us
- Foreseeability arguments (weak but present)
- Cash flow implications for us

**6. Recommended Approach**

1. Accept the meeting invitation for 22/23 July
2. Prepare a counter-position at EUR 20.5M / 70 days with full justification
3. Identify "red lines" (my suggestion: EUR 19.0M minimum / 60 days minimum)
4. Be prepared to accept a settlement in the EUR 19-20M / 60-70 day range
5. Ensure any settlement includes clear provisions for provisional CoolTech order

**7. Timing**

BEU's offer expires 31 July. We should respond formally by 19 July (tomorrow) indicating we wish to negotiate, with meeting proposed for 23 July.

Please let me know your thoughts. Happy to discuss by phone this evening if needed.

Best regards,
