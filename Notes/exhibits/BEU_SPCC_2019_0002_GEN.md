**Date:** 1 February 2019

Project Manager

Dear Mr. Horák,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – NOTICE OF SITE POSSESSION

In accordance with Sub-Clause 2.1 of the Contract, Borduria Energy Utilities S.A. hereby gives the Contractor possession of the Site, or so much of the Site as may be required to enable the Contractor to commence and proceed with the execution of the Works in accordance with the programme.

**Site Possession Details:**

**Date of Possession:** 1 February 2019

**Area Provided:**

Possession is hereby granted for the entire Site area as defined in the Contract, with the exception of the following:

**Excluded Area:** The northeastern portion of the Site, approximately 2.1 hectares, bounded by:
- North: Site boundary (adjacent to Route 7)
- East: Site boundary
- South: Internal access road (as shown on Site Plan drawing BEU-SP-001)
- West: Coordinates N 465,250m / E 623,180m (approximate)

This excluded area is shown hatched in red on the attached Site Possession Plan (Drawing BEU-SP-002).

**Reason for Exclusion:**

The excluded area is currently subject to ongoing negotiations with an adjacent industrial facility (Klow Chemical Works) regarding a boundary easement matter. BEU anticipates this matter will be resolved within approximately 60 days, following which possession of this area will be provided to SPCC.

We do not anticipate this temporary exclusion will impact SPCC's ability to commence work, as the main construction activities in the first phase will be focused on the western and central portions of the Site. However, we acknowledge that SPCC may wish to assess the potential programme impact, and we are committed to resolving the access issue as expeditiously as possible.

**Site Condition:**

The Site is provided in "as is" condition. SPCC is advised to conduct a thorough inspection and document the existing conditions, particularly:
- Surface conditions and topography
- Existing structures or foundations (if any)
- Surface drainage patterns
- Existing vegetation
- Any visible evidence of contamination or unusual conditions

**Utilities and Services:**

Temporary utility connection points are provided at the locations shown on Drawing BEU-SP-003:

1. **Electrical Power:** 
   - Location: Eastern boundary, coordinates N 465,100m / E 623,450m
   - Supply: 400V, 3-phase, 200A capacity
   - Connection: Via temporary construction board (SPCC to provide own distribution)

2. **Water Supply:**
   - Location: Southern boundary, coordinates N 464,950m / E 623,280m
   - Supply: Municipal water, 100mm connection, ~3 bar pressure
   - Metered connection (SPCC responsible for consumption charges)

3. **Sewer Connection:**
   - Location: Southern boundary, near water supply point
   - Connection: 150mm diameter to municipal system
   - For welfare facilities drainage only (no process discharge)

**Access:**

Primary site access is via the eastern gate off Route 7. Gate is currently secured with padlock. Keys and access codes have been provided to Mr. Pavel Novotný during this morning's site handover meeting.

SPCC is responsible for maintaining site security from this date forward. BEU will remove its temporary security arrangements by 8 February 2019.

**Site Survey Data:**

Site control survey benchmarks have been established at the four corners of the Site as shown on Drawing BEU-SP-004. Benchmark coordinates and elevations are provided in the attached Survey Data sheet.

**Environmental and Regulatory Matters:**

1. **Environmental Permit:** The Construction Environmental Permit issued by the Bordurian Ministry of Environment (Permit No. ENV-2018-KE-0247) is in full force and effect. A copy has been provided to SPCC previously.

2. **Archaeological Watching Brief:** In accordance with permit conditions, an archaeological watching brief is required during initial earthworks. The appointed archaeologist (Dr. Ivana Stojković) will coordinate with SPCC's site team.

3. **Protected Species:** No protected species or habitats have been identified on the Site. However, if any are encountered during works, all activities must cease and the Ministry of Environment must be notified immediately.

**Handover Meeting:**

This letter confirms the site handover meeting held this morning at 10:00 at the Site. Attendees:
- Branko Simić (BEU)
- Pavel Novotný (SPCC)
- Tomáš Polák (SPCC)
