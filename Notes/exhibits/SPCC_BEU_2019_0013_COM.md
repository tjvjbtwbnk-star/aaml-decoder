**Subject: Resubmission of Claim for Extension of Time - Delayed Site Access (DE-001) with Additional Supporting Evidence**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clauses 2.1 and 8.4; Your Ref: BEU/SPCC/2019/0008-COM dated 18 April 2019**

Dear Ms. Nikolić,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

We refer to:

(a) Our original claim submission dated 4 April 2019 (Reference: SPCC/BEU/2019/0010-COM);

(b) The Employer's rejection dated 18 April 2019 (Reference: BEU/SPCC/2019/0008-COM);

(c) Our request for reconsideration dated 19 April 2019;

(d) The discussion at PMM-004 on 29 April 2019.

In accordance with the agreement at PMM-004 that parties would meet to discuss this matter, and in advance of such meeting, we hereby resubmit our claim with additional supporting evidence and analysis addressing the specific points raised in the Employer's rejection.

**2. RESPONSE TO EMPLOYER'S ANALYSIS**

We address each point raised in the Employer's letter of 18 April 2019:

**2.1 Area Affected (Employer's Paragraphs 3.2-3.3)**

The Employer states that the NE area represents only 8.4% of the Site and was designated for "secondary activities." We respectfully disagree with this characterisation:

(a) While the NE area is 2.1 hectares of 25 hectares total (8.4%), the impact is not proportional to area. The NE area was critical for:
   - Ground investigation completion (allowing full site characterisation)
   - Temporary access road alignment
   - Stormwater management infrastructure (affecting site-wide drainage)
   - Equipment laydown and storage

(b) The activities planned for the NE area, while not direct construction of permanent works, were essential enabling works that supported the critical path activities.

**2.2 Ground Investigation (Employer's Paragraph 3.3(a))**

The Employer states that only 2 boreholes were affected. This is incorrect:

(a) Boreholes BH-17 through BH-24 (8 boreholes total) were located in or required access through the NE area. See attached **Appendix F: Borehole Location Plan with Access Routes**.

(b) The drilling subcontractor (BGS) confirmed in writing that they could not access BH-17 to BH-24 during the restricted period. See attached **Appendix G: BGS Confirmation Letter**.

(c) As a result of the access restriction, BGS demobilised on 8 March 2019 after completing accessible boreholes, and had to remobilise in early April to complete the NE area investigation. This remobilisation added 5 days and additional cost.

**2.3 Critical Path Impact (Employer's Paragraphs 3.3(b), 3.3(c), 3.4)**

The Employer contends that NE area works are not on the critical path. We clarify our position:

(a) Our claim is not that the NE area works themselves are on the critical path, but that delays to these works caused consequential delays to activities that are on or near the critical path.

(b) The programme logic demonstrates the following dependency chain:

```
Ground Investigation Complete → Geotechnical Report → Foundation Design Approval → Piling Works → Foundation Construction → Equipment Installation
```

(c) The incomplete ground investigation (missing BH-17 to BH-24 data) delayed finalisation of the Geotechnical Design Report by 4 weeks. This is documented in the attached **Appendix H: Geotechnical Report Revision Log**.

(d) The Geotechnical Report delay in turn delayed Foundation Design Approval. The Engineer's comments on Batch 2 specifically referenced incomplete geotechnical data in two Category A comments.

(e) See attached **Appendix I: Revised Time Impact Analysis** which traces the logic chain from ground investigation delay through to critical path impact.

**2.4 Mitigation (Employer's Paragraph 3.5)**

The Employer suggests SPCC did not implement mitigation measures. This is incorrect:

(a) **Re-sequencing:** We re-sequenced borehole drilling to prioritise accessible locations, completing 16 of 24 boreholes before the access issue forced a hold. See **Appendix J: Drilling Sequence Comparison (Planned vs Actual)**.

(b) **Earthworks Advancement:** We commenced earthworks in the Admin Building area 2 weeks ahead of the original programme to utilise resources that would otherwise have been working in the NE area.

(c) **Design Acceleration:** We brought forward design activities for non-affected areas, including Cooling Tower foundations, which are now ahead of programme.

(d) Without these mitigation measures, the impact would have been 60+ days (the full period of restricted access). The 45-day claim already reflects significant mitigation.

**3. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION**

The following additional documentation is attached:

| Appendix | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| F | Borehole Location Plan with Access Routes |
| G | BGS Confirmation Letter (dated 12 April 2019) |
| H | Geotechnical Report Revision Log |
| I | Revised Time Impact Analysis (window analysis method) |
| J | Drilling Sequence Comparison |
| K | Earthworks Re-sequencing Records |
| L | Contemporaneous Site Diary Extracts (expanded) |
| M | Photographic Evidence of Exclusion Zone |

**4. REVISED CLAIM**

Based on the additional analysis presented herein, we maintain our claim for Extension of Time of **45 calendar days**.

We note that a strict application of the programme logic without mitigation would support a claim of 52 days. However, recognising the Contractor's duty to mitigate and in the spirit of reaching an amicable resolution, we have maintained the original 45-day claim.

**5. COST CLAIM**

5.1 In addition to the Extension of Time claimed, the Contractor is entitled to additional costs arising from the delayed Site access.

5.2 A detailed cost claim is currently being prepared and will be submitted separately within 14 days.

5.3 Preliminary assessment indicates additional costs in the range of EUR 180,000 to EUR 220,000, comprising:

- BGS remobilisation costs
- Extended site establishment costs
- Disruption to earthworks planning
- Additional supervision costs

**6. REQUEST**

6.1 We respectfully request that the Employer reconsiders its position based on the additional evidence and analysis provided herein.

6.2 We propose a meeting during the week of 6 May 2019 to discuss the Time Impact Analysis in detail and work toward an agreed position.

6.3 If the parties cannot reach agreement, we request that the matter be referred to the Engineer for determination under Sub-Clause 3.5, as contemplated at PMM-004.

6.4 We reserve all our rights under the Contract.

Yours sincerely,
