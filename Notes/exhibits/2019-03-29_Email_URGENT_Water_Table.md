**Subject:** URGENT: High water table discovered in turbine hall area  
**Importance:** High

Dear Dragan,

I need to alert you urgently to a significant geotechnical issue we've discovered in the Gas Turbine Hall foundation area.

**Discovery:**

During final analysis of our ground investigation data, we've identified a perched water table at approximately 5-6m depth in the GT Hall area (boreholes BH-01, BH-02, BH-16). This is significantly shallower than the 8-9m depth indicated in the preliminary site investigation data from 2017.

More concerning, when we drilled through a sand lens at 5-8m depth in these locations, we observed artesian conditions - water rapidly rose 2-3m above the static level, indicating confined aquifer pressure.

**Why This Matters:**

The GT Hall foundations are designed at approximately 4.5-5.5m depth, which means:
1. They will intercept the perched water table
2. Excavation will encounter artesian pressure conditions
3. Standard dewatering will be inadequate
4. Foundation design may need to be modified to resist uplift

This was not anticipated based on the Contract geotechnical information.

**Immediate Implications:**

1. **Foundation Design:** We need to revise the GT Hall foundation design urgently. This may require deeper/heavier foundations, piled foundations, or pressure relief systems.

2. **Dewatering:** We need a deep well dewatering system instead of standard wellpoints. This is significantly more complex and expensive (estimated EUR 350,000-450,000 vs. EUR 80,000 originally anticipated).

3. **Programme:** The additional design work, specialist dewatering contractor procurement, and pre-drainage requirements will delay GT Hall foundation start by an estimated 12-18 weeks.

4. **Cost:** Preliminary estimate of additional costs: EUR 1-3 million depending on foundation solution required.

**What We're Doing:**

- Detailed hydrogeological assessment underway (completion 10 April)
- Evaluating foundation design alternatives
- Engaging specialist dewatering contractors
- Preparing formal Sub-Clause 4.12 notice (being issued today)

**What We Need from BEU:**

1. **Urgent meeting** to discuss technical solution - can we meet early next week (1-5 April)?
2. **Quick decisions** on foundation design approach to minimize programme delay
3. **Environmental permit** clarification - will we need permit modification for increased discharge?

I've attached:
- Borehole logs showing the artesian conditions
- Preliminary hydrogeological assessment
- Photos taken during drilling showing water rising in boreholes

This is a genuine geotechnical discovery that neither party anticipated. It's a significant issue but we believe it's manageable with the right technical approach and collaborative problem-solving.

Jiří Procházka is issuing formal Sub-Clause 4.12 notice today, but I wanted to give you immediate heads-up on the technical issues.

Can we talk today? I'm available any time after 10:00.
