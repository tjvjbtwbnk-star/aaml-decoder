## Minutes

### 1. Review of Previous Minutes and Actions

Minutes of WPM-008 dated 3 April 2019 were approved with one amendment: Item 3 to clarify that contamination was "suspected" rather than "confirmed" at that date.

**Action Review:**

| Action | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| WPM-008/01: Complete NE area survey | J. Svoboda | Complete - see Agenda Item 5 |
| WPM-008/02: Submit contamination test results | A. Kováč | Complete |
| WPM-008/03: Prepare soil contamination assessment report | A. Kováč | Complete - TR-004 issued 8 April |
| WPM-008/04: Submit earthworks traffic management plan | P. Novotný | Complete |
| WPM-008/05: Submit near miss report | J. Svoboda | Complete |

### 2. Contaminated Soil Situation Update

A. Kováč presented the findings of the Soil Contamination Assessment Report (TR-004) issued on 8 April 2019.

**Key Points:**
- Contamination confirmed in GT1 area with TPH up to 4,120 mg/kg (limit: 1,000 mg/kg)
- Estimated 5,100 m³ of contaminated soil requiring removal
- Three remediation options assessed; excavation and disposal recommended
- Preliminary cost estimate: EUR 985,000 (direct costs)
- Programme impact: 8-10 weeks delay to GT1 foundation works

I. Petrović acknowledged receipt of TR-004 and the associated formal notice (SPCC/BEU/2019/0011-TEC). She confirmed BEU is reviewing the report and will respond formally.

D. Kostić raised concerns about the cost estimate, noting that disposal costs appeared high. A. Kováč explained that the Szohôd facility is the only licensed hazardous waste receiver in Borduria, and costs are reflective of market rates.

I. Petrović confirmed that BEU would proceed with notification to the Bordurian EPA as required by regulation. She noted this was an Employer obligation under the Contract.

M. Santos emphasised the importance of progressing this matter expeditiously given the potential programme impact. She recommended that a technical meeting be held to agree the remediation approach.

**Decision:** Technical Coordination Meeting to be held on 12 April 2019 to discuss remediation approach.

**Action:** WPM-009/01 - D. Kostić to arrange TCM on contaminated soil remediation | Due: 12 April 2019

### 3. Design Review Status - Basic Design Milestone

Dr. W. Braun presented the design status update.

**Basic Design Package Status:**

| Batch | Status | Comments |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Batch 1 - Process/Performance | Approved (subject to minor comments) | DPI issued approval 12 April |
| Batch 2 - Civil/Structural | Comments addressed, resubmission 11 April | 8 outstanding comments |
| Batch 3 - Mechanical | Under review | Comments expected 15 April |
| Batch 4 - Electrical/I&C | Under review | Comments expected 18 April |

M. Santos confirmed that DPI is working to expedite reviews but noted that the quality of initial submissions has required multiple review cycles. The contractual milestone of 15 April 2019 for Basic Design Approval will not be achieved.

Dr. W. Braun expressed concern about the number of comments on Batch 2 relating to the now-affected GT1 foundation area. He noted that the contamination discovery may require design revisions in any case.

I. Petrović stated that BEU expected the Contractor to maintain design quality irrespective of site conditions and that delays to design approval were primarily due to submission quality.

M. Horák responded that SPCC had submitted comprehensive design packages on schedule and that review periods had exceeded contractual timeframes in some cases. He noted this was a matter for separate discussion.

**Action:** WPM-009/02 - Dr. W. Braun to submit Batch 2 Rev A by 11 April 2019 | Due: 11 April 2019

### 4. Earthworks Progress

P. Novotný reported on earthworks status:

- Earthworks equipment mobilisation complete (2 excavators, 4 dump trucks, 1 dozer)
- Topsoil stripping commenced 8 April in Admin Building area
- Approximately 2,400 m³ topsoil stripped to date
- Mass excavation to commence 15 April in Admin Building area
- GT1 area earthworks on hold pending contamination resolution

T. Polák confirmed that productivity has been good in the accessible areas. Weather conditions have been favourable.

B. Simić noted no issues with traffic management; the plan submitted by SPCC is working well.

### 5. NE Area Survey Results

J. Svoboda presented the survey results for the previously restricted NE area:

- Topographic survey complete
- General ground conditions consistent with main site
- No anomalies identified
- Area suitable for planned use (laydown, temporary access, stormwater)
- Survey data transmitted to design team

The NE area can now be included in the earthworks programme without restriction.

### 6. Procurement Update

M. Horák provided procurement status:

**Civil Works Subcontract:**
- Tender evaluation complete
- Borduria Civil Contractors (BCC) recommended for award
- Contract value: EUR 28.4 million
- Award letter to be issued 12 April, mobilisation targeted 1 May

**Long-Lead Equipment:**
- Gas Turbines: Manufacturing on schedule
- HRSG: Some slippage on engineering deliverables - being monitored
- Steam Turbine: On schedule
- Main Transformer: Contract negotiations ongoing

K. Hoffmann requested confirmation of the civil works subcontract value for records. M. Horák confirmed EUR 28.4 million.

### 7. Programme Review

M. Dvořák presented the programme status:

**Baseline Programme:**
- Rev 0 submitted 1 March 2019, comments received from BEU
- Rev 1 in preparation incorporating BEU comments
- Formal approval targeted for PMM-004 (29 April)

**Current Status:**
- Overall: 4 days behind baseline (primarily design review duration)
- Critical path: Through GT equipment delivery and installation
- Float: Reduced from 15 days to 11 days
- **Key Risk:** Contaminated soil situation may impact critical path if GT1 foundation delayed significantly

M. Dvořák noted that if remediation extends beyond 8 weeks, the critical path may shift to run through GT1 foundation works.

I. Petrović expressed concern about the early erosion of float and requested that SPCC present recovery measures at PMM-004.

**Action:** WPM-009/03 - M. Dvořák to prepare recovery options for PMM-004 | Due: 25 April 2019

### 8. HSE Matters

J. Svoboda and D. Ilić jointly presented the HSE report:

- Man-hours worked this week: 1,456
- LTI: 0
- Incidents: 0
- Near Misses: 0
- Toolbox talks: 6 delivered

**Contaminated Soil Safety Measures:**
- Exclusion zone established around contaminated area
- PPE requirements upgraded for any personnel entering zone
- Air monitoring equipment on order
- Specific risk assessment completed (attached to TR-004)

D. Ilić commended SPCC's proactive approach to managing the contamination safety aspects.

### 9. Any Other Business

**Easter Arrangements:** M. Horák confirmed site will operate with reduced crew 19-22 April. Security and emergency response maintained throughout.

**Civil Works Subcontractor Kick-off:** P. Novotný proposed a coordination meeting with BCC following contract award. Targeted for 15-17 April.
