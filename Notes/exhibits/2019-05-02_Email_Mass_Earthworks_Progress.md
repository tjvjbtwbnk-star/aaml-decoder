Dear Branko,

As discussed at the site coordination meeting this morning, I wanted to provide a written summary of the earthworks progress as we move into May.

**COMPLETED WORKS:**

| Area | Activity | Status | Volume |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Admin Building | Topsoil strip | 100% | 3,200 m³ |
| Admin Building | Mass excavation | 100% | 13,500 m³ |
| Admin Building | Formation preparation | 100% | 2,400 m² |
| Cooling Tower | Topsoil strip | 100% | 4,100 m³ |
| Cooling Tower | Mass excavation | 65% | 8,450 m³ of 13,000 m³ |
| NE Laydown Area | Site clearance | 100% | 8,500 m² |
| NE Laydown Area | Access road formation | 80% | 450 lin.m |

**KEY ACHIEVEMENTS THIS WEEK:**

1. Admin Building excavation reached formation level on 30 April - this area is now ready for piling
2. BCC mobilised successfully on 29 April - first piling rig operational from 2 May
3. Extended working hours (10-hour shifts) implemented from 1 May as agreed
4. Productivity averaging 540 m³/day (20% above target)

**COMING WEEK (3-10 May):**

| Activity | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Cooling Tower excavation | Complete to formation |
| NE Laydown Area | Complete access road and hardstanding |
| HRSG Area topsoil strip | Commence |
| Admin Building | Piling operations by BCC |

**GT1 TURBINE HALL AREA:**

As you know, earthworks in the GT1 area remain on hold pending:
1. Completion of contamination remediation
2. GT1 foundation redesign confirmation

Following TCM-002 on Monday, I understand the foundation solution has been agreed (deep bored piles). We are coordinating with Andrej on the revised excavation requirements and expect to receive updated drawings next week.

Once remediation is complete (targeted end of June per current programme), we can commence GT1 excavation immediately. I have reserved plant capacity for this.

**SOIL DISPOSAL:**

Clean excavated material is being stockpiled in the designated area for later reuse in backfilling and landscaping. Quantities to date:

- Topsoil: 7,300 m³ (stockpiled for landscaping)
- Suitable subsoil: 14,200 m³ (for general fill)
- Unsuitable material: 3,800 m³ (disposed off-site)

Maria inspected the stockpiles yesterday and was satisfied with the segregation and protection measures.

**WEATHER:**

We have been fortunate with dry conditions throughout April. The forecast for next week shows some rain on Wednesday/Thursday, but nothing that should significantly impact progress. I have arranged for additional pumping capacity to be on standby.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or would like a site walkover to review progress.

Best regards,
