**Subject:** CONFIDENTIAL - Commercial Settlement Strategy for 7 October Meeting
**Importance:** High
---

Tomáš, Miroslav,

Following today's PMM-009, I want to share my thoughts on our strategy for the senior commercial meeting on 7 October. This email is strictly confidential.

**1. Current Commercial Position**

| Item | SPCC Position | BEU Position | Difference |
|------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| DE-002 EOT | 68 days | 35 days | 33 days |
| DE-002 Cost | EUR 2.95M | EUR 2.15M | EUR 800K |
| DE-004 EOT | 18 days | 0 days | 18 days |
| DE-004 Cost | EUR 127.5K | EUR 0 | EUR 127.5K |
| Foundation Delay Damages | EUR 0 | EUR 25K | EUR 25K |
| **Total Difference** | | | **~51 days + EUR 952.5K** |

**2. Our Risks**

Before we negotiate, we need to be realistic about our risks:

(a) **DE-002:** The Engineer has already determined 35 days. While we disagree, overturning this at arbitration is uncertain. The ground conditions were harder, but BEU will argue we should have anticipated variability.

(b) **DE-004:** BEU's position on Contractor responsibility for TSO interface has some merit. The Employer's Requirements do mention Contractor interface responsibility. Our case is strong but not certain.

(c) **Foundation Delay Damages:** EUR 25K is a small amount. Fighting it sends a signal about future delays but may not be worth the relationship damage.

(d) **GT1 Concrete Issue:** This is our biggest risk right now. If cores confirm non-compliance, we face:
- Remediation costs (our risk if workmanship)
- Potential programme delay
- BEU goodwill lost
- Reduced leverage in negotiations

**3. BEU's Position**

Based on today's PMM, I sense that BEU is also interested in settlement but will be tough:
- Dr. Vladić is concerned about the GT1 issue
- Nikolić maintains hard positions in writing but may be more flexible in discussion
- Petrović is focused on programme delivery

**4. Settlement Strategy**

I recommend we approach the 7 October meeting with the following strategy:

**4.1 Package Deal**

Rather than fight each item individually, propose a package settlement:

| Item | Our Claim | Proposed Settlement |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| DE-002 EOT | 68 days | 45-50 days |
| DE-002 Cost | EUR 2.95M | EUR 2.40M |
| DE-004 EOT | 18 days | 8-10 days |
| DE-004 Cost | EUR 127.5K | EUR 50K |
| Foundation Damages | EUR 0 | Accept EUR 25K |
| **Net** | | **~55-60 days + EUR 2.4M** |

**4.2 Negotiation Levers**

We have some levers:
- Willingness to withdraw Foundation delay dissatisfaction
- Flexibility on DE-004 (our weakest claim)
- Good relationship with DPI (Weber is fair)
- Programme recovery – we can commit to protecting milestones

**4.3 Timing**

The GT1 concrete issue creates timing pressure:
- If we settle before core results, we preserve goodwill
- If cores are bad and we haven't settled, BEU will be harder to deal with
- Conversely, if cores are good, our leverage improves

**Recommendation:** Try to reach heads of agreement on 7 October, before core results on 7 October afternoon.

**5. Walk-Away Position**

Our minimum acceptable settlement:

| Item | Minimum |
|------|---------|
| DE-002 EOT | 40 days |
| DE-002 Cost | EUR 2.2M |
| DE-004 | Withdraw if necessary |
| Foundation Damages | Accept EUR 25K |

Below this, we proceed to formal dispute resolution.

**6. GT1 Concrete Contingency**

If core results are bad (received during or after the meeting):
- Acknowledge the issue openly
- Commit to remediation at our cost
- Request that claims settlement be kept separate from quality issues
- Avoid letting BEU use the concrete issue as leverage

**7. Proposed Agenda for 7 October**

1. Opening positions (brief – we know these)
2. SPCC proposal for package settlement
3. BEU response
4. Negotiation
5. Heads of agreement (if possible)
6. Next steps

**8. Attendees**

From SPCC:
- Tomáš Králík (lead)
- Jiří Procházka
- Miroslav Horák (if needed for technical points)

Please confirm your availability and let me know if you want to discuss before Thursday.

Regards,
