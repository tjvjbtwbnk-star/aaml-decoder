Dear Mr. Kostić,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – GROUND INVESTIGATION PROGRAMME - PROPOSAL

Further to discussions at Project Management Meeting No. 1 and subsequent correspondence, I am pleased to submit SPCC's proposed Ground Investigation Programme for your review and approval.

**Enclosed Documents:**
1. Ground Investigation Programme (Document No. SPCC-CI-001, Rev 0) - 32 pages
2. Borehole Location Plan (Drawing No. SPCC-CI-101, Rev A)
3. Testing Schedule and Laboratory Requirements

**Background and Objectives:**

The Contract includes limited existing geotechnical data from preliminary site investigations conducted in 2017. While this data provides a general understanding of site conditions, it is insufficient for detailed foundation design of the major structures and equipment.

The proposed ground investigation aims to:
- Confirm soil stratification and properties across the site
- Determine bearing capacity and settlement characteristics
- Assess groundwater conditions and seasonal variations
- Identify any problematic soils or conditions requiring special treatment
- Provide design parameters for foundation engineering

**Scope of Investigation:**

**Boreholes:**
- **Total Number:** 24 boreholes
- **Depth Range:** 15m to 35m below existing ground level
- **Locations:** Strategically positioned at major structure locations (see attached plan)

**Borehole Distribution:**
- Gas Turbine Hall area: 6 boreholes (30m depth)
- HRSG foundations: 4 boreholes (25m depth)
- Steam Turbine Hall: 4 boreholes (30m depth)
- Cooling Tower area: 3 boreholes (20m depth)
- Electrical Building: 2 boreholes (20m depth)
- Administration Building: 2 boreholes (15m depth)
- General site areas: 3 boreholes (20m depth)

**In-Situ Testing:**
- Standard Penetration Tests (SPT) at 1.5m intervals in all boreholes
- Continuous sampling in selected boreholes
- Groundwater level monitoring and standpipe installation in 8 boreholes
- In-situ permeability tests (falling head tests) in selected locations

**Laboratory Testing Programme:**

**Classification Tests (all samples):**
- Natural moisture content
- Bulk density
- Particle size distribution (sieve and hydrometer analysis)
- Atterberg limits (liquid limit, plastic limit)
- Organic content determination

**Strength Tests (selected samples):**
- Unconfined compressive strength (cohesive soils)
- Triaxial compression tests (consolidated undrained, 12 tests)
- Direct shear tests (8 tests)
- California Bearing Ratio (CBR) for pavement design (6 tests)

**Consolidation and Compressibility:**
- One-dimensional consolidation tests (oedometer) - 8 tests
- Determination of compression and swelling indices

**Chemical Tests (selected samples):**
- pH value
- Sulphate content (ground and groundwater)
- Chloride content
- Organic content
- Aggressive content assessment for concrete durability

**Execution Schedule:**

- **Mobilisation of drilling rig:** 18 February 2019
- **Drilling operations:** 18 February - 15 March 2019 (approximately 4 weeks)
- **Laboratory testing:** Progressive, completion by 30 March 2019
- **Draft Geotechnical Report:** 5 April 2019
- **Final Geotechnical Report:** 15 April 2019

The schedule allows for weather contingencies and assumes no major access restrictions or unforeseen ground conditions.

**Contractor and Resources:**

SPCC has engaged **Balkan Geotechnical Services Ltd.** (Borduria) to execute the ground investigation. BGS is a reputable local firm with extensive experience in power plant projects in the region.

**Resources:**
- 1 x truck-mounted rotary drilling rig
- 1 x lightweight percussion rig (for shallow investigations)
- Experienced drilling crew and field geologist
- Laboratory facilities in Szohôd (certified to ISO/IEC 17025)

**Health, Safety and Environment:**

All drilling operations will be conducted in accordance with:
- SPCC Project HSE Plan
- BGS company HSE procedures
- Bordurian drilling and excavation safety regulations

Key safety measures:
- Daily safety briefings for drilling crew
- Proper fencing and signage around active boreholes
- Drill rig inspection and maintenance protocols
- Proper handling and disposal of drilling fluids and cuttings
- Environmental protection measures (spill kits, containment)

**Coordination Requirements:**

To ensure efficient execution, we require the following from BEU:

1. **Access to NE Site Area:** Several boreholes are located in the northeastern area that is currently excluded from site possession. We need access to this area for drilling operations during the investigation period (estimated 5 days of work in that zone). Can this be arranged?

2. **Utility Clearances:** Although we have reviewed available utility drawings, we request confirmation that no buried utilities exist at the proposed borehole locations, particularly near the site boundaries.

3. **Archaeological Clearance:** We understand an archaeological watching brief is required. Should the archaeologist be present during drilling operations, or is notification sufficient?

**Geotechnical Report Deliverables:**

The Final Geotechnical Report will include:

- Executive summary and recommendations
- Site description and investigation methodology
- Soil profile descriptions and boring logs
- Laboratory test results and interpretation
- Groundwater conditions assessment
- Geotechnical design parameters for foundations
- Foundation type recommendations
- Construction considerations (excavation stability, dewatering requirements)
- Pavement design parameters for roads and laydown areas

**Approval Request:**

We request BEU's approval of this Ground Investigation Programme to allow mobilisation of the drilling contractor as scheduled. Any significant changes to the scope or timing would impact our foundation design schedule and potentially delay the programme.

Should you require any clarification or wish to discuss any aspect of the investigation programme, please contact our Lead Civil Engineer, Mr. Andrej Kováč, or myself.

Yours sincerely,

**Andrej Kováč**
