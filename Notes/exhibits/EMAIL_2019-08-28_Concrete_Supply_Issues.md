**Subject:** Concrete Supply Issues - Coordination Required
---

Pavel,

I need to bring to your attention some concrete supply coordination issues that arose today during the GT1 Foundation Slab pour.

**1. Today's Pour (GT1 Foundation Slab)**

The pour commenced at 06:30 as planned with an estimated volume of 420 m³. The pour was completed at 17:30 (11 hours duration vs 8 hours planned).

**Issues Encountered:**

| Time | Issue | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 09:15 | Szohôd Concrete truck #4 arrived with incorrect slump (180mm vs 150mm specified) | Rejected - 8 m³ wasted, 45 min delay |
| 11:30 | Site batching plant mixer fault - temporary shutdown | 40 min delay |
| 14:00 | Traffic congestion on Route 12 - 3 trucks delayed | 30 min waiting time, risk of cold joints |
| 15:45 | Pump line blockage | 25 min delay |

**Total delays: approximately 2.5 hours**

Despite the issues, the pour was completed successfully with no cold joints. Maria Santos (DPI) was present throughout and has accepted the pour subject to cube test results.

**2. Root Cause Analysis**

**2.1 Szohôd Concrete Quality**
This is the second time Szohôd Concrete has delivered out-of-specification material (first incident was 15 July). The site batching plant was primary supply today but we needed Szohôd backup due to volume.

**Recommendation:** Formal warning letter to Szohôd Concrete; consider alternative backup supplier.

**2.2 Site Batching Plant**
The mixer fault was a worn agitator blade. Maintenance was conducted but this indicates the plant needs a full service.

**Recommendation:** Schedule full maintenance this weekend (31 Aug - 1 Sep) during the curing period for GT1.

**2.3 Traffic**
Route 12 congestion is a recurring issue during afternoon peak hours. This affects concrete deliveries from both sources.

**Recommendation:** For future large pours (HRSG Pours 8-10), either:
- Complete pours before 14:00; or
- Arrange police escort for delivery vehicles; or
- Stockpile backup supply on site before pour commencement

**3. HRSG Pours 8-10**

These pours are scheduled for:
- Pour 8: 30 August (380 m³)
- Pour 9: 3 September (350 m³)
- Pour 10: 6 September (340 m³)

Given the issues today, I recommend the following for these pours:

1. **Primary supply:** Site batching plant (post-maintenance)
2. **Backup supply:** Pre-positioned truck mixer on site with 8 m³ ready mix
3. **Pour timing:** Start at 05:30 to complete before afternoon traffic
4. **Quality control:** Additional slump tests (every 50 m³ instead of every 100 m³)

**4. Concrete Stock**

Current cement stock on site: 45 tonnes (approximately 5 days at current usage)
Aggregates: Adequate
Admixtures: Adequate

Next cement delivery scheduled 30 August (25 tonnes). Please confirm this is still proceeding.

**5. Coordination Meeting**

I suggest a brief coordination meeting tomorrow (29 August) at 07:00 to finalise the arrangements for Pour 8. Attendees: myself, Goran (BCC), Ondřej (QM), and batching plant supervisor.

Please confirm if you can attend or if you want me to proceed and report back.

Regards,
