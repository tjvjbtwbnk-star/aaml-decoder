**Subject: Comments on Detailed Design – Civil Package**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; SPCC/DPI/2019/0003-TEC dated 14 June 2019**

Dear Dr. Braun,

We refer to your submission of the Detailed Design – Civil Package (Batch 1) dated 14 June 2019 under the above reference. Following our technical review, we provide the following comments for your attention and action.

**1. General Comments**

1.1 The overall quality of the submission is satisfactory and demonstrates good progress from the Basic Design stage.

1.2 We note that several drawings remain marked as "Preliminary" or "For Information Only." Please confirm the programme for issue of final "For Construction" versions.

1.3 Drawing numbering convention has changed from Basic Design stage. Please provide a cross-reference matrix showing Basic Design to Detailed Design drawing relationships.

**2. Specific Technical Comments**

**2.1 Turbine Hall Foundations (Drawings TH-STR-001 to TH-STR-015)**

| Item | Drawing | Comment | Priority |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 2.1.1 | TH-STR-003 | GT1 foundation reinforcement detail shows 32mm bars at 150mm centres. Please confirm this is consistent with the redesigned foundation following ground condition changes. | High |
| 2.1.2 | TH-STR-007 | Embedded plate detail for turbine sole plate anchors requires dimensional verification against TurboMach interface drawing TM-IF-023. | High |
| 2.1.3 | TH-STR-009 | Steam turbine pedestal detail shows anchor bolt pocket dimensions that appear inconsistent with equipment vendor data. Please verify. | Medium |
| 2.1.4 | TH-STR-012 | Expansion joint locations not shown. Please add. | Medium |

**2.2 HRSG Area Structures (Drawings HR-STR-001 to HR-STR-022)**

| Item | Drawing | Comment | Priority |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 2.2.1 | HR-STR-004 | HRSG foundation dead and live load assumptions to be confirmed against CoolTech data. | High |
| 2.2.2 | HR-STR-011 | Stack foundation shows 8m diameter base. Please confirm compatibility with stack supplier requirements. | Medium |
| 2.2.3 | HR-STR-018 | Pipe rack foundation spacing appears to have changed from Basic Design. Please confirm and provide design calculation update. | Medium |

**2.3 Cooling Tower Area (Drawings CT-STR-001 to CT-STR-008)**

| Item | Drawing | Comment | Priority |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 2.3.1 | All | We note these drawings are marked "Subject to DE-003 Resolution." Please confirm the status of these drawings once DE-003 is determined. | For information |
| 2.3.2 | CT-STR-002 | Common raft foundation design appears adequate for either wet or hybrid cooling tower option. Please confirm. | Medium |

**2.4 Underground Utilities (Drawings UG-CIV-001 to UG-CIV-012)**

| Item | Drawing | Comment | Priority |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 2.4.1 | UG-CIV-003 | Cooling water culvert routing conflicts with cable trench CT-05 shown on UG-CIV-007. Please resolve. | High |
| 2.4.2 | UG-CIV-005 | Fire water ring main does not show connection to admin building. Please add. | Medium |
| 2.4.3 | UG-CIV-009 | Surface water drainage design to be verified against 1-in-50 year storm event per local regulations. Calculation reference not provided. | High |

**3. Design Calculations**

3.1 Calculation reference DD-CALC-CIV-001 (Turbine Hall Foundation) has been reviewed. We note the following:

- Load combinations appear appropriate
- Seismic design basis requires confirmation – current design uses Zone 2 criteria. Please confirm this is consistent with latest geotechnical recommendations.
- Pile capacity verification required once GT1 bored piling is complete and pile test results are available.

3.2 Please provide calculation references for HRSG and Cooling Tower foundation designs.

**4. Interface Coordination**

4.1 Please confirm that all civil/structural designs have been coordinated with:
- TurboMach (gas turbines)
- CoolTech (HRSG and cooling systems)  
- Sildavo Electrical Works (transformers and switchgear)

4.2 Interface control drawings are requested for each major equipment item.

**5. Response Requirements**

Please provide responses to the above comments within 14 calendar days (by 23 July 2019) as follows:

- **High priority items:** Formal response with revised drawings or supporting documentation
- **Medium priority items:** Written response confirming action to be taken
- **For information items:** Acknowledgement

Outstanding comments will be tracked through the Design Task Force meetings.

We remain committed to supporting the efficient progression of the detailed design and are available to discuss any of the above comments at your convenience.

Yours sincerely,

**Dragan Kostić**
Technical Manager
