**Subject: Incident Notification – Lifting Incident 18 September 2019**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 6.7**

Dear Mrs. Petrović,

In accordance with Sub-Clause 6.7 of the Conditions of Contract and the Health and Safety Plan, we hereby formally notify the Employer of a safety incident that occurred on 18 September 2019.

**1. Incident Summary**

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Date/Time | 18 September 2019, 14:35 |
| Location | HRSG Area, Grid Line H6 |
| Activity | Structural steel beam erection |
| Classification | Medical Treatment Case (MTC) |

**2. Description**

During lifting of a structural steel beam for installation at the HRSG area, the rigging sling shifted causing the beam to rotate. The beam contacted a temporary work platform, dislodging a scaffold board and small items which fell to ground level.

Two workers (J. Novák and P. Stanković, both BCC employees) who were within the exclusion zone perimeter were struck by falling debris.

**3. Injuries**

| Worker | Injury | Treatment | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| J. Novák | Laceration to forearm | 4 stitches | Returned to light duties |
| P. Stanković | Bruising to shoulder | Medical evaluation | Returned to normal duties |

Both workers received medical treatment and have returned to work. No lost time has resulted.

**4. Immediate Actions**

- Lifting operations were suspended immediately
- First aid administered on site
- Workers transported to hospital for evaluation and treatment
- Area secured pending investigation
- Investigation commenced same day

**5. Investigation Findings**

The investigation has identified the following root causes:

1. **Failure to follow lift plan:** A single-point lift was used instead of the specified two-point lift configuration.

2. **Inadequate supervision:** The appointed rigger was temporarily absent; an unqualified person proceeded with the lift.

3. **Exclusion zone breach:** Workers entered the exclusion zone during the lifting operation.

**6. Corrective Actions**

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Lifting operations suspended pending investigation | Complete |
| All rigging equipment reinspected | Complete |
| Safety alert issued to all personnel | Complete |
| Rigger retraining programme | In progress |
| Physical exclusion zone barriers | In progress |
| Lift plan review for all steel erection | In progress |
| Disciplinary review | In progress |

**7. Regulatory Reporting**

This incident does not meet the threshold for mandatory reporting to the Borduria Labour Inspectorate (no fatality, no serious injury). However, we will cooperate fully with any enquiries should they arise.

**8. Impact**

Lifting operations were suspended for approximately 18 hours. Operations resumed on 19 September 2019 following implementation of enhanced controls. No impact on programme is anticipated.

**9. Attachments**

The full incident investigation report (IR-2019-008) is attached for your records.

We deeply regret this incident and are committed to ensuring that the corrective actions are fully implemented to prevent recurrence. We remain committed to our goal of zero harm on this project.

Please contact Peter Horváth (HSE Manager) if you require any additional information.

Yours sincerely,

**Miroslav Horák**
