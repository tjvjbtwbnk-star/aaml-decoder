**Subject:** RE: Site access NE area - status enquiry

Dear Miroslav,

Thank you for your letter ref. SPCC/BEU/2019/0005-COM dated 18 February 2019 regarding the northeastern site area access issue.

I want to respond quickly to provide you with an update, ahead of our formal written response to your Sub-Clause 20.1 notice which Ana will prepare.

**Current Status:**

We have been working intensively with our legal team and Klow Chemical Works to resolve the boundary easement matter. The situation is as follows:

**Progress Made:**
- Negotiations are progressing constructively
- Klow Chemical Works has indicated willingness to reach agreement
- Key commercial terms have been agreed in principle
- Legal documentation is being drafted

**Outstanding Items:**
- Final legal review of easement agreement language
- Sign-off from Klow Chemical Works board (meeting scheduled for 28 February)
- Registration of easement with Bordurian Land Registry

**Realistic Timeline:**
- We anticipate the easement agreement will be signed during the first week of March
- Full site access (permanent, unrestricted) should be available by **mid-March 2019**
- This is approximately 2 weeks later than our original "end of March" estimate, but represents our best current assessment

**Temporary Access for Drilling:**

The temporary access arrangement we've provided (25 Feb - 8 Mar) should still be adequate for your ground investigation drilling in the NE area. We understand from Branko that your drilling contractor is making good progress on the main site areas and is on schedule to access the NE area during the temporary access period.

**Impact Assessment:**

I understand your need to preserve your contractual rights by issuing the Sub-Clause 20.1 notice. This is entirely appropriate and we accept that there has been a delay in providing full site possession compared to the contract date of 1 February.

However, I would like to discuss with you:

1. **Whether the impacts can be minimized:** Given that we now have a clear timeline for permanent access (mid-March), can we work together to ensure the ground investigation and subsequent works can proceed without material delay?

2. **Mitigation measures:** Are there any actions BEU can take (beyond the temporary drilling access we've already arranged) that would help reduce the impact?

3. **Alternative site arrangements:** Can the site layout and logistics be planned in a way that minimizes dependence on the NE area in the near term?

**My Proposal:**

Rather than having this become a formal dispute matter, I'd like to propose that we:

1. Meet this week (Thursday or Friday) to discuss the practical implications and potential mitigation measures
2. Have a joint review of your programme to understand the actual critical path impacts
3. Work collaboratively to minimize delays and additional costs
4. Agree on a fair and reasonable resolution that recognizes the delay but also recognizes BEU's efforts to mitigate and the fact that permanent access will be provided in the near term

I believe this approach will be more productive than a formal claims process, and will keep the project on a positive collaborative footing.

**BEU's Position:**

For transparency, I should state BEU's preliminary position:

1. We acknowledge that full site possession was not provided on 1 February as required by the Contract.

2. We accept responsibility for this and recognize SPCC may be entitled to relief under Sub-Clause 2.1.

3. However, we believe the impacts are likely to be minimal given:
   - The temporary access we've provided for critical ground investigation work
   - The fact that the NE area is not required for works until April at the earliest
   - The permanent access will be provided by mid-March (well before the area is needed for construction)
   - SPCC has 2.1 hectares available for mobilisation and early works (representing 91.6% of the site)

4. We would expect any claim to reflect the actual impacts rather than theoretical maximum impacts.

5. We would want to reach an amicable resolution rather than requiring Engineer's determination.

**Next Steps:**

Please let me know if you're willing to meet this week to discuss this pragmatically. I will be at the site visit on Friday (BEU management visit) so perhaps we could meet after that?

In the meantime, Ana will prepare our formal response to your Sub-Clause 20.1 notice, which will be issued by the end of this week as required.

I appreciate your professional approach to this matter and I'm confident we can resolve it constructively.

Best regards,
