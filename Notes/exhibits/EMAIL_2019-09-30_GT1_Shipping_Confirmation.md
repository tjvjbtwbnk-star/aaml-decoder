**7. Important Note – Foundation Issue**

I am aware of the GT1 foundation concrete investigation. TurboMach has been informed that there may be a delay to installation. They have confirmed:

- GT1 can be stored on site for up to 6 months without affecting warranty
- Preservation requirements: Indoor storage, dehumidification, monthly rotation
- They will provide technical support for any foundation assessment

However, if the foundation issue requires major remediation, we need to advise TurboMach as soon as possible regarding revised installation dates. This affects their commissioning team scheduling.

| GT1 shipping | 15 October 2019 |
| Arrival Klow-North | 5-7 November 2019 |

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,
