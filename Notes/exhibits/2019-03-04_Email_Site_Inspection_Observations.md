**Subject:** Daily site inspection observations

Dear Pavel,

Following today's site inspection, I wanted to share a few observations:

**Positive Points:**
- Site housekeeping excellent - well organized and clean
- Ground investigation drilling proceeding safely and efficiently
- HSE standards being maintained
- Good coordination between SPCC and drilling contractor

**Minor Items for Attention:**
- Some material deliveries staged near site entrance could obstruct emergency access - suggest relocating to designated laydown area
- Temporary fencing near BH-18 location showing some damage (wind?) - recommend repair
- Site access road developing some rutting from heavy vehicles - may need maintenance before civil works start

Nothing urgent, just routine observations. Overall, very pleased with site management.

Best regards,

**Maria Santos**
