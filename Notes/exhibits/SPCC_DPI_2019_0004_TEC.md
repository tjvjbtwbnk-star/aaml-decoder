**Subject: Revised Basic Design Documents - Batch 2 Rev B (Civil/Structural)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 5.2 (Contractor's Documents); Your Ref: DPI/SPCC/2019/0005 dated 3 May 2019**

Dear Dr. Weber,

**1. SUBMISSION**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 5.2 of the Conditions of Contract and in response to your review comments dated 3 May 2019, we hereby submit the revised Basic Design Documents - Batch 2 Rev B (Civil/Structural) for the Engineer's approval.

**2. DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED**

The following revised documents are enclosed:

| Doc. No. | Title | Rev | Change Summary |
|----------|-------|-----|----------------|
| BCCPP-CV-002 | Site Layout and Grading Plan | B | FFL corrected to +102.150m |
| BCCPP-CV-008 | Underground Utilities Layout | B | Cable duct routing revised |
| BCCPP-CV-011 | Main Building Steel Framing | B | Load combinations revised per EC3 |

**3. COMMENT RESPONSES**

This submission addresses the three Category B comments raised in DPI/SPCC/2019/0005:

**Comment B-53 (BCCPP-CV-002):**

*Issue:* Admin Building floor level discrepancy (civil vs architectural drawings)

*Resolution:* The civil drawings have been revised to show Finished Floor Level at +102.150m, consistent with the architectural design. The discrepancy arose from an earlier design iteration that was not updated. All related sections and details have been checked for consistency.

*Documents affected:* BCCPP-CV-002 Rev B (updated), BCCPP-CV-005 Rev A (no change required - already correct)

**Comment B-54 (BCCPP-CV-008):**

*Issue:* Cable duct routing through piled foundation zone in HRSG area

*Resolution:* The cable duct alignment has been revised to route around the pile group. The revised routing adds approximately 15m to the cable run length but eliminates the clash. An interface drawing (BCCPP-CV-008-IF-001) is included showing the duct/pile interface clearances.

*Coordination:* The revised routing has been coordinated with the electrical design team. Sophie Dumont has confirmed no impact on cable sizing.

**Comment B-55 (BCCPP-CV-011):**

*Issue:* Design code inconsistency (EC3 referenced but AISC load combinations used)

*Resolution:* The design has been confirmed as EC3 (EN 1993) throughout. The load combination tables have been revised to show EN 1990 combinations correctly. The apparent AISC references in the original submission were formatting errors that have been corrected.

*Verification:* A senior structural engineer has reviewed all calculations to confirm EC3 compliance. A certification statement is attached at Appendix A.

**4. CATEGORY C OBSERVATIONS**

The Category C observations (C-61 to C-65) have been noted and will be incorporated in the Detailed Design phase as follows:

| Observation | Response |
|-------------|----------|
| C-61 (Compaction testing frequency) | Will be included in earthworks specification |
| C-62 (Pile spacing for group effects) | Will be shown on detailed pile layout drawings |
| C-63 (Pile length verification) | Pile lengths to be confirmed during installation |
| C-64 (Drainage outlet capacity) | 1:100 year storm calculation to be included |
| C-65 (Foundation monitoring recommendations) | PIT requirements included in ITP-CV-001 |

**5. GT1 FOUNDATION**

The GT1 Turbine Hall foundation design (BCCPP-CV-013 series) will be submitted separately as indicated in our letter SPCC/BEU/2019/0015-TEC dated 10 May 2019.

Target submission: 31 May 2019

**6. REQUEST FOR APPROVAL**

We respectfully request the Engineer's approval of Batch 2 Rev B within 7 days of this submission (i.e., by 30 May 2019) to maintain the design approval programme.

Upon approval of this submission, together with the outstanding Batch 3 and Batch 4 packages and the GT1 foundation design, we anticipate achieving Basic Design Approval by 12 June 2019.

**7. ELECTRONIC COPIES**

Electronic copies of all documents have been uploaded to the Project Document Management System (PDMS) under folder "Design/Basic Design/Batch 2 Rev B".

We remain available to discuss any aspects of this submission.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Wilhelm Braun**
Engineering Manager
Syldavian Power Construction Consortium
