**Subject:** Proposed kick-off meeting agenda

Dear Ivana,

Following the exchange of letters between our respective Project Directors, I am pleased to send through a proposed agenda for our kick-off meeting. I understand from our telephone conversation this morning that Monday, 21 January would work well for both sides, and we are happy to meet at BEU's offices in Szohôd.

**Proposed Agenda:**

1. **Introductions and Project Organisation** (30 min)
   - Key personnel from each party
   - Organisation charts and communication protocols
   - Contact details distribution

2. **Contract Administration Procedures** (45 min)
   - Communication procedures and document control
   - Meeting schedule (weekly progress meetings, monthly PMMs, etc.)
   - Submittal procedures and review timelines
   - Payment procedures and schedule

3. **Programme Review** (45 min)
   - Discussion of preliminary programme
   - Key milestones and interfaces
   - Reporting requirements

4. **Site Handover and Mobilisation** (30 min)
   - Site access and possession procedures
   - Site establishment requirements
   - Security and access control arrangements

5. **Design and Engineering** (30 min)
   - Design submission schedule
   - Review and approval procedures
   - Interface management

6. **HSE and Quality** (30 min)
   - HSE Plan review
   - Quality Plan overview
   - Emergency procedures

7. **Next Steps and Actions** (20 min)

**Logistics:**
- Proposed time: 09:00 - 14:00 (including working lunch)
- Venue: BEU offices, Szohôd
- SPCC attendees: Approximately 8-10 people (list to follow)

Could you please confirm if this agenda is acceptable and provide details of the specific meeting room location? We will arrange our own transport from Klow.

I also wanted to mention that Dr. Heinrich Weber from DPI has indicated his availability to attend, which I think would be beneficial for establishing the three-party working relationship from the outset.

Looking forward to a productive meeting.

Best regards,
