**Subject:** RE: GT1 Foundation Slab - Authorisation and Next Steps
---

Andrej,

Thank you for the comprehensive briefing this afternoon. I have discussed this matter with Miroslav and we have agreed the following approach.

**1. Decision**

We will proceed with core testing before formal notification. However, we must be transparent about this with DPI/BEU at next week's meeting. The rationale is:

- A single failed cube does not necessarily indicate defective concrete
- Core testing will provide definitive evidence of in-situ strength
- Premature notification could create unnecessary alarm
- We are not concealing the issue – we flagged it at WPM-029 today

**2. Core Testing Programme**

| Activity | Date | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Core drilling | 27-28 Sep | 6 cores from west slab area |
| Core preparation | 28-29 Sep | End treatment, measurement |
| 7-day accelerated test | 30 Sep - 6 Oct | Heated curing correlation |
| Standard 28-day test | 30 Sep - 28 Oct | Full compliance test |
| Initial results | 7 Oct | Accelerated test results |

**3. Core Locations**

Based on our discussion, cores should be taken as follows:

| Core | Location | Distance from FDN-GT1-005 |
|------|----------|---------------------------|
| C1 | Grid intersection W3/A | 0m (cube location) |
| C2 | Grid intersection W3/B | 2m north |
| C3 | Grid intersection W2/A | 3m east |
| C4 | Grid intersection W4/A | 3m west |
| C5 | Grid intersection W3/C | 4m north |
| C6 | Grid intersection W2/B | 4m northeast |

This pattern will allow us to determine if the issue is localised or extends across the western slab area.

**4. Structural Assessment**

Andrej – please prepare a preliminary structural assessment assuming the following scenarios:

| Scenario | In-situ Strength | Action Required |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| A | ≥40 MPa | No action – cube anomaly |
| B | 36-39 MPa | Design reassessment – may be acceptable |
| C | 32-35 MPa | Remediation likely required |
| D | <32 MPa | Major intervention required |

For scenarios C and D, please outline potential remediation options with preliminary cost and programme impacts.

**5. Notification**

I have agreed with Miroslav that we will:

- Inform DPI/BEU at WPM-030 (2 October) that core testing is underway
- Provide initial results at PMM-009 (30 September) if available, or by 7 October
- Issue formal NCR if cores confirm non-compliance

Ondřej – please prepare the draft NCR documentation so we are ready to issue immediately if required.

**6. Confidentiality**

Until we have core test results, this matter should be treated as confidential within the project team. The following people are aware:

- M. Horák (Project Manager)
- P. Novotný (Construction Manager)
- A. Kováč (Lead Civil)
- O. Malý (Quality Manager)
- W. Braun (Engineering Manager)

Do not discuss with BCC, BSS, or external parties until we have definitive results.

**7. Contingency Planning**

If cores confirm non-compliance, we need to be prepared for:

- Programme impact: GT1 installation may be delayed
- Cost impact: Remediation costs (Contractor risk if workmanship issue)
- Relationship impact: BEU will be concerned given recent incidents

Let's reconvene Monday morning (30 September) at 08:00 to review progress before PMM-009.

Regards,
