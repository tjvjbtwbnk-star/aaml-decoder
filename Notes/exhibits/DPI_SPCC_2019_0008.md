**Subject: Approval of Basic Design - GT1 Turbine Hall Foundation**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 5.2 (Contractor's Documents)**

Dear Dr. Braun,

**1. DOCUMENTS REVIEWED**

We refer to the GT1 Turbine Hall Foundation design documents submitted on 5 June 2019, reviewed on an expedited basis.

The following documents have been reviewed:

| Doc. No. | Title | Rev |
|----------|-------|-----|
| BCCPP-CV-013 | GT1 Foundation General Arrangement | A |
| BCCPP-CV-013-001 | Pile Layout Plan | A |
| BCCPP-CV-013-002 | Pile Cap Details | A |
| BCCPP-CV-013-003 | Foundation Sections | A |
| BCCPP-CV-013-CAL | Structural Design Calculations | A |
| BCCPP-CV-013-GEO | Geotechnical Design Report | A |
| BCCPP-CV-013-SPEC | Pile Installation Specification | A |

**2. DESIGN BASIS**

The design has been developed based on:
- Deep bored pile solution agreed at TCM-002 (29 April 2019)
- Revised geotechnical parameters from additional ground investigation
- Contaminated zone avoidance (piles founded below contaminated/aquifer zone)

**Key Design Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Pile Type | Bored cast-in-situ, C40/50 |
| Pile Diameter | 750mm |
| Pile Length | 28-32m |
| Number of Piles | 28 |
| Design Capacity | 4,500 kN (ULS) |
| Founding Stratum | Dense sand (N>50) at 30-35m |

**3. APPROVAL STATUS**

The Engineer hereby **approves** the GT1 Turbine Hall Foundation design documents as listed above.

**4. CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL**

This approval is granted subject to the following conditions:

(a) **Pile Installation Records:** Detailed records to be maintained for each pile including:
- Drilling log
- Concrete volume
- Reinforcement placement
- Any observations during installation

(b) **Pile Testing:** 
- 100% pile integrity testing (PIT)
- Static load test on minimum 2 piles (7% of total)
- Testing to be witnessed by Engineer

(c) **Founding Level Verification:** Actual founding level to be verified by Engineer prior to concreting each pile. Pile lengths may be adjusted based on ground conditions encountered.

(d) **Contamination Protocol:** Installation through remediated zone to follow contamination control protocol in specification.

**5. BASIC DESIGN APPROVAL - COMPLETE**

With this approval of the GT1 Foundation design, together with the previously approved Batches 1-4, **Basic Design Approval is hereby achieved** as of 12 June 2019.

The Contractor may proceed with Detailed Design for all packages.

**6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**

The Engineer acknowledges the collaborative effort of all parties in achieving Basic Design Approval, particularly through the Design Task Force. This milestone, while later than the contractual date of 15 April 2019, represents a solid foundation for the Detailed Design and construction phases.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Heinrich Weber**
