# LETTER

**SYLDAVIAN POWER CONSTRUCTION CONSORTIUM**  
15 Ottokar IV Boulevard  
Klow, Syldavia

**Reference:** SPCC/DPI/2019/0002-TEC  
**Date:** 25 February 2019

Dr. Heinrich Weber  
Engineer's Representative  
Dobrić & Partners International  
Schottengasse 14  
1010 Vienna, Austria

Dear Dr. Weber,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – REVISED BASIC DESIGN DOCUMENTS - BATCH 1 REV B

**NOTE:** This letter is sent in advance of the formal submission scheduled for 5 March 2019. It provides an overview of our approach to addressing your review comments and requests your agreement to a brief extension of the submission deadline.

---

## BACKGROUND

We received your review comments on Basic Design - Batch 1 via letter ref. DPI/SPCC/2019/0002 dated 12 February 2019, containing 74 comments (16 Category A, 40 Category B, 18 Category C).

We have been working systematically through these comments and have made substantial progress. However, two developments have emerged that affect our ability to meet the 5 March submission deadline:

### 1. Design Change - Ambient Temperature

Your Comment A-1 identified that our 30°C design ambient temperature required better justification. Upon conducting detailed meteorological analysis (20 years of data), we have concluded that a **32°C design ambient temperature** is more appropriate (2% exceedance basis, standard industry practice).

**Impact:** This 2°C increase affects multiple systems:
- Heat rejection (cooling system sizing)
- Gas turbine air intake system
- Heat exchangers and auxiliary cooling
- Building HVAC systems

While not a fundamental redesign, this change requires careful review of affected systems across all four design batches to ensure consistency. We are currently coordinating these changes between our process, mechanical, and civil design teams.

### 2. Supplementary Firing Requirement Clarification

Your Comment A-7 raised questions about the HRSG supplementary firing requirement. We need clarification from BEU on:
- Required firing duty (MW thermal)
- Operating regime and frequency
- Whether this is a firm requirement or optional

This clarification will significantly affect the HRSG design and cost. We have requested urgent input from BEU but have not yet received definitive guidance.

---

## REQUESTED DEADLINE EXTENSION

Given these circumstances, we request a **5-day extension** to the submission deadline:

**Current deadline:** 5 March 2019  
**Requested revised deadline:** **10 March 2019**

**Justification:**

1. **Quality over speed:** We believe it is better to provide a thoroughly coordinated revised submission that properly addresses all comments, rather than rushing a submission that may require further revision.

2. **Ambient temperature change impact:** The additional 5 days will allow us to properly coordinate the 32°C design basis across all design disciplines and ensure no inconsistencies between batches.

3. **Supplementary firing clarity:** The additional time will allow BEU to provide clarification on this significant design feature, enabling us to provide a definitive design rather than making assumptions that may prove incorrect.

4. **Limited programme impact:** A 5-day extension to Batch 1 approval will not affect the overall mid-April Basic Design approval milestone, as other batches are still under review with later approval dates.

We acknowledge this is a departure from the 21-day response period specified in your letter, and we apologize for the request. However, we believe the additional time is justified by the circumstances and will result in a significantly better quality submission.

**Alternative approach:** If you are not comfortable with a 5-day extension, we could submit the bulk of the revised documents on 5 March with a supplementary submission on 10 March covering the ambient temperature coordination and supplementary firing details. However, we believe a single comprehensive submission on 10 March would be cleaner and more efficient to review.

Please confirm if the requested extension is acceptable.

- SPCC-PR-005: Equipment Duty Specifications - Gas Turbines (updated for ambient)
- SPCC-PR-006: Equipment Duty Specifications - HRSGs (substantial revision)
- SPCC-PR-007: Equipment Duty Specifications - Steam Turbine (minor updates)
- SPCC-PR-008: Performance Guarantees Calculation Basis (substantial revision)
- SPCC-PR-009: Cooling Water System Design Basis (substantial revision - larger cooling system)

**Supporting Documentation:**

In addition to the revised documents, we will provide:

1. **Comment Response Matrix** - Detailed response to all 74 comments showing:
   - Our response category (Accepted / Accepted with clarification / etc.)
   - Specific actions taken
   - Location in revised documents where comment is addressed
   - Any outstanding items requiring further discussion

2. **Meteorological Analysis Report** - Statistical analysis of 20 years of temperature data supporting the 32°C design basis

3. **Performance Curves** - Output and efficiency from 15°C to 40°C ambient, as requested in Comment A-1

4. **Cooling System Selection Study** - Detailed comparison of cooling alternatives and justification for hybrid tower selection (Comment A-8, A-9)

5. **Design Change Impact Assessment** - Summary of how the 32°C ambient basis affects other design packages

## ITEMS REQUIRING DISCUSSION

As mentioned in my email to Emilia Kowalska on 22 February, there are 5 items (3 Category A, 2 Category B) where we need further discussion with you and/or BEU:

**1. Comment A-7 - Supplementary Firing Requirement**
   - Awaiting BEU clarification on operational requirement and duty
   - May require meeting with BEU operations team

**2. Comment A-8, A-9 - Cooling System Selection**
   - We will provide detailed selection study as requested
   - Question: Do you want this as part of basic design documents or separate technical memorandum?

**3. Comment B-18 - GT Exhaust Temperature Tolerance**
   - Clarification needed on how to present temperature (range vs. formula vs. table)

**4. Comment B-23 - HRSG Warranty Period**
   - Clarification on whether 2-year warranty needs explaining or just noting

**5. Comment B-31 - Fuel Gas Pressure at Battery Limits**
   - Minor clarification on interface pressure responsibility

We propose a brief technical coordination meeting on **5 March (morning)** to resolve these items, followed by finalization of the revised documents for submission on 10 March. This would be more efficient than multiple rounds of written correspondence.

Suggested attendees:
- SPCC: Dr. Wilhelm Braun, Dr. Yuki Tanaka
- DPI: Dr. Heinrich Weber, Emilia Kowalska
- BEU: Dragan Kostić (for items requiring Employer input)

Meeting duration: 2-3 hours

Please advise if this approach is acceptable and if you can accommodate the meeting.

## SUBSEQUENT DESIGN BATCHES

For your information, the status of other design batches:

**Batch 2 (Civil/Structural)** - Submitted 15 Feb, under DPI review, comments expected 8 March

**Batch 3 (Mechanical Systems)** - Submitted 18 Feb, under DPI review, comments expected 11 March

**Batch 4 (Electrical)** - On track for submission **25 February** (today)

All subsequent batches are being coordinated with the revised 32°C ambient temperature basis to ensure consistency.

---

## PROGRAMME IMPLICATIONS

**Impact on Overall Design Approval:**

The requested 5-day extension to Batch 1 will result in:
- Batch 1 Rev B submission: 10 March (instead of 5 March)
- DPI review period: 10-31 March (21 days)
- Batch 1 approval: 31 March (instead of 26 March)

**Impact on Mid-April Basic Design Approval Milestone:**

The other batches have later review completion dates:
- Batch 2: 8 March comments + 21 days response = 29 March approval
- Batch 3: 11 March comments + 21 days response = 1 April approval
- Batch 4: 25 Feb submission + 21 days = 18 March comments + 21 days response = 8 April approval

Therefore, Batch 4 remains the critical item for overall Basic Design approval. A 5-day delay to Batch 1 does not affect the overall mid-April milestone.

**Coordination of All Batches:**

We are working to ensure all four batches are coordinated and consistent, particularly regarding the 32°C ambient temperature basis. This holistic approach will result in a better quality design and smoother approval process.

## REQUEST FOR CONFIRMATION

We request your confirmation of:

1. **5-day extension** to Batch 1 revised submission (new deadline: 10 March 2019)

2. **Technical coordination meeting** on 5 March morning to resolve outstanding items

Please respond by **27 February** if possible to allow us to plan our work effectively.

We appreciate your understanding and flexibility on this matter. The quality of your review has identified important issues that warrant careful resolution, and we believe the additional time will result in a significantly improved design that will avoid problems in the detailed engineering phase.

Should you require any immediate clarification or wish to discuss this request, please contact me directly.
