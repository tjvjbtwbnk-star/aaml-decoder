Klow, Syldavia

**Reference:** SPCC/BEU/2019/0005-COM  
**Date:** 18 February 2019

Dear Ms. Nikolić,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – NOTICE UNDER SUB-CLAUSE 2.1 – DELAYED SITE ACCESS (NORTHEASTERN AREA)

In accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1 of the Contract (Contractor's Claims), SPCC hereby gives notice that we have experienced an event or circumstance that may entitle us to an extension of the Time for Completion and/or additional payment.

This notice is issued within the 28-day period required by Sub-Clause 20.1.

---

## EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE

**Nature of Event:** Delayed provision of full site possession contrary to Sub-Clause 2.1 (Right of Access to the Site).

**Date of Event:** 1 February 2019 (Date of Site Possession)

**Relevant Contract Provision:** Sub-Clause 2.1 of the Contract states:

*"The Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of, all parts of the Site within the time (or times) stated in the Appendix to Tender. The Employer shall be responsible for any delays or costs incurred by the Contractor which are directly attributable to the Employer's failure to give any such right or possession."*

---

## FACTS

1. **Partial Site Possession:** On 1 February 2019, BEU provided site possession by letter ref. BEU/SPCC/2019/0002-GEN. However, possession excluded the northeastern portion of the site (approximately 2.1 hectares) due to an unresolved boundary easement matter with Klow Chemical Works.

2. **Contract Requirement:** The Contract required full site possession from 1 February 2019 with no exclusions specified. The Appendix to Tender does not identify any areas to be excluded from initial possession.

3. **Impact on Ground Investigation:** SPCC's approved Ground Investigation Programme (SPCC-CI-001, Rev 0) includes 6 boreholes located within the excluded northeastern area. These boreholes are essential for foundation design of structures and facilities planned for that zone.

4. **Temporary Access Arrangement:** BEU has arranged temporary access to the NE area for drilling operations only, from 25 February to 8 March 2019, per letter ref. BEU/SPCC/2019/0004-TEC dated 15 February 2019.

5. **Ongoing Restriction:** Full site possession of the NE area has not been provided. BEU has indicated the matter is expected to be resolved "by end of March" but no firm date has been confirmed.

---

## CONTRACTUAL BASIS FOR CLAIM

**Sub-Clause 2.1 - Right of Access to the Site:**

The Employer's obligation under Sub-Clause 2.1 is clear and unqualified: full site possession must be provided within the time stated in the Appendix to Tender (1 February 2019). 

The exclusion of 2.1 hectares (approximately 8.4% of the total site area) constitutes a failure to provide complete site possession as required by the Contract.

The fact that BEU has arranged temporary access for drilling operations does not remedy the contractual breach, as:
- The temporary access is limited in scope (drilling only) and duration (25 Feb - 8 Mar)
- SPCC cannot plan, execute, or mobilize other works in the NE area
- The temporary access is subject to restrictive conditions that impact efficiency and cost
- Full possession has still not been provided 17 days after the contractual date

**Sub-Clause 20.1 - Contractor's Claims:**

This provision entitles SPCC to claim for:
- Extension of Time for Completion, and/or
- Additional payment for Cost

arising from delays or additional costs that are attributable to the Employer's failure to give site possession.

---

## CONSEQUENCES AND IMPACTS

SPCC is currently assessing the full impacts of the delayed site access. Preliminary assessment indicates the following consequences:

### 1. GROUND INVESTIGATION DELAY AND ADDITIONAL COST

**Impact:** 
- Ground investigation cannot be completed in a single continuous campaign
- Drilling of 6 NE area boreholes must be deferred to the temporary access period (25 Feb - 8 Mar)
- This creates inefficiency in drilling operations and may require additional mobilisation

**Potential Consequences:**
- Extended standby time for drilling equipment (between main campaign and NE area work)
- Potential need for separate mobilisation if timing cannot be coordinated efficiently
- Additional supervision and management costs
- Risk of delay to geotechnical report if laboratory testing is extended

**Estimated Additional Cost:** EUR 25,000 - 40,000 (preliminary, subject to confirmation)

### 2. DESIGN PROGRAMME RISK

**Impact:**
- If geotechnical report is delayed beyond 15 April target, foundation design approval may be delayed
- This would impact civil works commencement date (currently 1 May 2019)

**Potential Consequences:**
- Delay to critical path activities
- Potential extension of Time for Completion
- Additional costs if civil works subcontractor mobilisation is delayed

**Programme Impact:** To be determined following completion of ground investigation (estimated impact: 5-15 days, subject to detailed assessment)

### 3. SITE PLANNING AND LOGISTICS CONSTRAINTS

**Impact:**
- SPCC cannot plan site layout and logistics for the NE area with certainty
- Cannot mobilise civil works or establish facilities in the NE area until full access is provided
- Uncertainty regarding access timing creates planning inefficiency

**Potential Consequences:**
- Suboptimal site layout and logistics planning
- Potential need to relocate temporary facilities or laydown areas
- Reduced flexibility in site operations
- Additional management and planning costs

**Estimated Impact:** To be quantified once permanent access date is confirmed

### 4. FUTURE WORKS IN NE AREA

**Impact:**
- Multiple activities are planned for the NE area beyond ground investigation:
  - Site drainage infrastructure (April-May 2019)
  - Materials laydown and storage areas (May-August 2019)
  - Access roads and haul routes (May-June 2019)
  - Perimeter fencing and security (March-April 2019)

- If full access is not provided by end of March as indicated by BEU, these activities will be delayed or will require alternative arrangements at additional cost.

**Potential Consequences:**
- Programme delays to multiple activities
- Cascading impacts on critical path
- Increased costs due to work sequence changes or temporary arrangements
- Potential impact on Time for Completion

**Programme Impact:** To be determined based on actual access provision date

## SPCC'S POSITION

SPCC acknowledges that:

1. BEU has made efforts to mitigate the impact by arranging temporary access for ground investigation drilling.

2. BEU has stated the permanent access issue is expected to be resolved by end of March 2019.

3. The temporary access arrangement may be sufficient to allow the ground investigation to be completed without material delay (subject to actual drilling progress).

However, SPCC maintains that:

1. The failure to provide full site possession on 1 February 2019 is a breach of Sub-Clause 2.1.

2. SPCC is entitled to claim for delays and costs arising from this breach.

3. The temporary access arrangement, while helpful, does not eliminate the impacts or remedy the contractual breach.

4. Until full permanent access to the NE area is provided, SPCC's ability to execute the works efficiently and in accordance with the planned programme is impaired.

## CLAIM RESERVATION AND FURTHER PARTICULARS

This notice is issued to preserve SPCC's rights under the Contract. As required by Sub-Clause 20.1:

1. **Further Particulars:** SPCC will submit fully detailed particulars of this claim, including:
   - Detailed assessment of programme impact
   - Quantification of additional costs
   - Supporting documentation (drilling contractor quotations, programme analysis, etc.)
   - Claim for extension of time and/or additional payment

   **Target Date for Submission of Particulars:** 15 March 2019 (or earlier if impacts become fully apparent)

2. **Continuing Impacts:** If the NE area access issue continues beyond end of March 2019 or if additional impacts become apparent, SPCC will submit further notices and updated particulars as appropriate.

3. **Mitigation:** SPCC is taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the impacts of delayed site access, including:
   - Coordinating drilling operations to maximize efficiency despite the access restrictions
   - Planning alternative site layouts and logistics arrangements
   - Engaging early with civil works subcontractors to maintain flexibility

4. **Good Faith:** SPCC remains committed to working collaboratively with BEU to resolve this matter and minimize impacts on the project. We appreciate BEU's efforts to secure temporary access and trust that permanent access will be provided as soon as possible.
