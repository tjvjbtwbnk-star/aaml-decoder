**Subject: Response to DE-004 Notice – Contractor's Responsibility**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; SPCC/BEU/2019/0027-COM dated 22 August 2019**

Dear Mr. Procházka,

We refer to your letter of 22 August 2019 purporting to give notice under Sub-Clauses 1.9 and 20.1 regarding the provision of grid connection data. This letter constitutes the Employer's formal response.

**1. Employer's Position**

1.1 The Employer does not accept that the Contractor has any entitlement to Extension of Time or additional cost in respect of this matter.

1.2 The Contractor's notice is rejected on both procedural and substantive grounds.

**2. Procedural Objections**

**2.1 Notice Requirements**

Sub-Clause 20.1 requires the Contractor to give notice "as soon as practicable, and not later than 28 days after the Contractor became aware, or should have become aware" of the event giving rise to the claim.

The Contractor states that the grid data was originally expected in June 2019. If the Contractor considers that the non-provision of this data constitutes a claim event, notice should have been given in June or early July 2019, not 22 August 2019.

The notice is therefore time-barred under Sub-Clause 20.1.

**2.2 Without Prejudice**

Notwithstanding the above, the Employer provides the following substantive response without prejudice to its procedural objection.

**3. Substantive Position**

**3.1 No Employer Obligation**

The Contractor relies upon Sub-Clause 1.9 which concerns "Delayed Drawings or Instructions." However:

(a) Grid connection data is not "Drawings" within the meaning of the Contract.

(b) Grid connection data is not an "Instruction" – it is technical information required for the Contractor's design.

(c) Sub-Clause 1.9 applies to information which "the Employer is required to give." There is no requirement in the Contract for the Employer to provide TSO data.

**3.2 Contractor's Design Responsibility**

Sub-Clause 5.1 states:

*"The Contractor shall be responsible for the design of the Works... The Contractor shall be deemed to have scrutinised... the Employer's Requirements... and to have obtained all necessary information..."*

The Contractor accepted design responsibility, including the obligation to obtain necessary technical information from all relevant sources. The TSO is a third party with whom the Contractor must interface.

**3.3 Employer's Requirements**

The Employer's Requirements (Volume 2 of the Contract) at Section 3.4.2 state:

*"The Contractor shall be responsible for all interfaces with the Transmission System Operator including obtaining necessary technical data for the design of the electrical systems."*

This clearly places the responsibility for obtaining TSO data on the Contractor.

**3.4 Employer's Assistance**

The Employer acknowledges that it has facilitated communication between the Contractor and the TSO. This assistance was provided voluntarily to support the project and does not:

(a) Create any contractual obligation on the Employer;
(b) Transfer responsibility for the interface to the Employer;
(c) Render the Employer liable for any delays in TSO responses.

**3.5 Contractor's Failure to Mitigate**

The Contractor has not adequately explained:

(a) Why it did not make direct contact with the TSO earlier in the project;
(b) What alternative sources of information it explored;
(c) Why design assumptions used by other power plant contractors in Borduria were not employed;
(d) What contingency was allowed in its design programme for third-party data.

**4. Analysis of Contractor's Claims**

**4.1 Design Delay**

The Contractor claims 21 days of design delay. However:

(a) The detailed electrical design was programmed for completion on 30 September 2019.
(b) This completion date can still be achieved with focused effort once data is received.
(c) The Contractor has had ample time to prepare provisional designs.
(d) Any delay is the Contractor's risk.

**4.2 Cost Claim**

The Contractor claims EUR 99,000 in costs. We note:

(a) "Standing time" is not recoverable – the design team should have been productively deployed on other activities.
(b) No substantiation has been provided for the claimed amounts.
(c) Any costs incurred are the Contractor's own costs arising from its design programming.

**5. Provision of Data**

5.1 Notwithstanding the above, the Employer confirms that the TSO data was received on 26 August 2019 and is transmitted herewith (Enclosure 1).

5.2 The data should be reviewed urgently and incorporated into the design.

5.3 We expect the Contractor to complete the electrical detailed design by 30 September 2019 as originally programmed.

**6. Conclusion**

6.1 The Contractor's notice under Sub-Clauses 1.9 and 20.1 is rejected.

6.2 The Contractor has no entitlement to Extension of Time or additional cost in respect of this matter.

6.3 The obtaining of TSO data was and remains the Contractor's responsibility under the Contract.

6.4 We request confirmation that the Contractor will complete the electrical detailed design by 30 September 2019.

We trust this clarifies the Employer's position.

Yours sincerely,
