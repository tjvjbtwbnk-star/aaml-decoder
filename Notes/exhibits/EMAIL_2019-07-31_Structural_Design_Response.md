**Subject:** Structural Design Comments - Response Required
---

Dear Wilhelm,

I hope you are well. I wanted to follow up on the Engineer's comments on the Structural Package (DPI/SPCC/2019/0008 dated 29 July) and highlight certain matters of particular concern to BEU.

As you know, the structural steel fabrication is scheduled to commence shortly and we need to ensure that any design changes are captured before shop drawings are finalised. I understand Balkan Steel is already preparing shop drawings for the Admin Building package.

**Priority Items from BEU Perspective**

While all of the Engineer's comments require response, I would specifically highlight the following as BEU's priorities:

**1. Crane Girder Connection (Ref 2.1.1)**

The fatigue design of the crane girder connection is critical for the long-term integrity of the turbine hall. Our internal review also noted that the single shear bolt detail appears light for the duty cycle. Please ensure the fatigue analysis is comprehensive and considers the full range of crane operations, including maintenance lifts.

**2. Column Base Plate Discrepancy (Ref 2.1.2)**

The M36 vs M30 bolt discrepancy between calculation and drawing must be resolved urgently. This affects foundation anchor bolt pockets which are being formed now. Please confirm which is correct and issue a formal clarification.

I note that the GT1 foundation pile cap formwork is being prepared. If the anchor bolt size needs to change, we need to know immediately.

**3. Seismic Capacity Design (Ref 2.4.4)**

Please confirm that all connections have been designed to the capacity design principles of EN 1998. This is a fundamental requirement and we would appreciate seeing the verification calculations.

**4. HRSG Thermal Movement Interface (Ref 2.2.2)**

The expansion joint locations must align with the HRSG thermal movement requirements. This has been a problem on other CCGT projects I have been involved with. Please confirm coordination with CoolTech on this point.

**Request**

Given the programme criticality, I would propose that we hold a technical meeting next week (5 or 6 August) to review your responses to the Engineer's comments before formal submission. This would allow BEU to provide any clarifications and potentially accelerate the consent process.

Please let me know if this would be acceptable and what date would work for your team.

Best regards,
