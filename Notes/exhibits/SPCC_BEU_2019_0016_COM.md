**Subject: Request for Variation Order - Contaminated Soil Disposal (VO-002)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 13.3 (Variation Procedure); BEU Instruction BEU/SPCC/2019/0009-TEC dated 25 April 2019**

Dear Ms. Nikolić,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 13.3 of the Conditions of Contract, we hereby submit a request for a Variation Order to cover the cost of contaminated soil remediation works in the GT1 Turbine Hall area.

This Variation Request follows the Employer's instruction dated 25 April 2019 (Reference: BEU/SPCC/2019/0009-TEC) directing the Contractor to proceed with contaminated soil remediation.

**2. BACKGROUND**

2.1 The discovery of contaminated soil conditions was notified to the Employer on 28 March 2019 (Reference: SPCC/BEU/2019/0009-TEC) and supplemented on 9 April 2019 (Reference: SPCC/BEU/2019/0011-TEC).

2.2 The contamination assessment (Technical Report TR-004) confirmed hydrocarbon contamination at levels exceeding Bordurian regulatory limits.

2.3 Following EPA approval and the Employer's instruction, remediation works commenced on 15 May 2019.

2.4 This Variation Request addresses the contaminated soil disposal and related works. It is separate from VO-001 (Additional Ground Investigation) submitted on 15 April 2019.

**3. SCOPE OF VARIATION WORKS**

The remediation works comprise the following activities:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 3.1 | Mobilisation of specialist remediation subcontractor (EnviroClean Ltd) |
| 3.2 | Installation of dewatering system for remediation excavation |
| 3.3 | Groundwater treatment system (oil/water separation, carbon filtration) |
| 3.4 | Excavation of contaminated soil (estimated 5,400 m³) |
| 3.5 | Loading, transport, and disposal at Szohôd Hazardous Waste Facility |
| 3.6 | Verification sampling and testing |
| 3.7 | Supply and placement of certified clean backfill material |
| 3.8 | Groundwater monitoring (during and post-remediation) |
| 3.9 | Air monitoring during excavation |
| 3.10 | Environmental compliance reporting |
| 3.11 | Demobilisation |

**4. CONTRACT PROVISIONS**

4.1 The original Contract scope did not include remediation of contaminated soil. The Employer's Requirements (Volume 2) stated that the Site was suitable for power plant construction without reference to contamination.

4.2 The contaminated soil conditions constitute an unforeseeable physical condition under Sub-Clause 4.12. The remediation works are required to address these conditions.

4.3 The Employer's instruction (BEU/SPCC/2019/0009-TEC) constitutes a Variation under Sub-Clause 13.1.

4.4 Under Sub-Clause 13.3, the Contractor is entitled to submit a proposal for the valuation of the Variation.

**5. COST BREAKDOWN**

The estimated cost of the contaminated soil remediation works is as follows:

| Item | Description | Amount (EUR) |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 5.1 | EnviroClean Ltd Subcontract | |
| | - Mobilisation/demobilisation | 35,000 |
| | - Dewatering system | 48,000 |

| | - Supply of certified clean fill (5,400 m³ @ EUR 28/m³) | 151,200 |
| | - Placement and compaction | 42,000 |
| | **Subtotal Backfill** | **193,200** |
| 5.4 | Groundwater Monitoring | |
| | - Monitoring wells installation (3 no.) | 18,000 |
| | - Monthly monitoring (6 months) | 24,000 |

**6. NOTES ON VALUATION**

6.1 **Contaminated Soil Volume:** The estimated volume of 5,400 m³ is based on the contaminated zone definition in the Employer's specification (1,000 mg/kg contour plus 2m buffer). Actual volume may vary based on verification sampling results.

6.2 **Disposal Tonnage:** Based on average density of 1.5 tonnes/m³, the estimated tonnage is 8,100 tonnes. The disposal rate of EUR 85/tonne is the confirmed rate from Szohôd Hazardous Waste Facility.

6.3 **Provisional Items:** Items 5.1 (transport) and 5.2 (disposal) are provisional and will be subject to re-measurement based on actual quantities.

6.4 **Backfill Specification:** The backfill rate is based on certified clean engineered fill meeting the specification in BEU/SPCC/2019/0009-TEC.

**7. EXTENSION OF TIME**

7.1 This Variation will cause delay to the GT1 foundation works and consequently to the overall programme.

7.2 A detailed Extension of Time claim for the ground conditions event (DE-002) will be submitted separately, encompassing both the remediation delay and the foundation redesign delay.

7.3 Preliminary assessment indicates an Extension of Time entitlement of 60-75 days.
