- Current exclusion is ~2.1 hectares of site

**PN** noted SPCC's concerns:
- Need access for ground investigation boreholes (short-term - 5 days)
- Will need access by mid-April for drainage works and laydown areas
- Any delay beyond mid-April could impact programme

**BS** committed to pushing for resolution and will update at next meeting.

**MS** requested that SPCC formally document any potential programme impact if access is not provided by mid-April.
