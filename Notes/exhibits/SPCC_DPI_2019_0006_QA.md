**Subject: GT1 Foundation Slab – Concrete Strength Investigation**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 7.5**

Dear Dr. Weber,

In accordance with our obligation to notify the Engineer of matters affecting the quality of the Works, we wish to inform you of an investigation currently underway regarding the GT1 foundation slab concrete.

**1. Background**

1.1 The GT1 foundation slab was poured on 28 August 2019 using C40/50 concrete with high-early-strength characteristics. The pour volume was 420 m³.

1.2 Six cube samples were taken during the pour from various locations across the slab, in accordance with the approved Inspection and Test Plan.

1.3 The 28-day cube test results were received on 25 September 2019.

**2. Test Results**

| Sample | Location | 28-day Strength (MPa) | Specified Min (MPa) | Status |
|--------|----------|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| FDN-GT1-001 | North | 52 | 40 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-002 | East | 55 | 40 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-003 | Centre | 51 | 40 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-004 | South | 47 | 40 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-005 | West | 36 | 40 | **Fail** |
| FDN-GT1-006 | SW Corner | 53 | 40 | Pass |

2.1 Sample FDN-GT1-005 from the western area of the slab has returned a 28-day compressive strength of 36 MPa, which is below the specified characteristic strength of 40 MPa.

**3. Investigation**

3.1 We have initiated an investigation to determine whether the cube test result is representative of the actual in-situ concrete strength.

3.2 Core samples are being extracted from the western slab area as follows:

| Core | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| C1-C3 | West area | Drilled 27 Sep |
| C4-C6 | West area | Drilled 28 Sep |

3.3 Core testing will be conducted at Szohôd Materials Testing laboratory:
- Accelerated test (7-day correlation): Results expected 7 October
- Standard 28-day test: Results expected 28 October

**4. Preliminary Assessment**

4.1 The failed cube test may be explained by one of the following:

(a) **Cube anomaly:** The cube may not be representative of the in-situ concrete due to sampling, curing, or testing variation.

(b) **Localised issue:** The western area concrete may have been affected by delayed placement, additional water, or inadequate compaction.

(c) **Systematic issue:** Unlikely given five of six cubes passed with significant margin.

4.2 A structural assessment is being prepared to determine the acceptability of the foundation if core results confirm strength below 40 MPa.

**5. Programme**

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Core drilling complete | 28 September |
| Accelerated test results | 7 October |
| Preliminary structural assessment | 7 October |
| Full report and recommendation | 10 October |
| Standard 28-day core results | 28 October |

**6. GT1 Delivery**

6.1 GT1 is scheduled for shipping on 15 October 2019 with site arrival expected mid-November.

6.2 We do not anticipate that this investigation will affect GT1 delivery. However, if remediation works are required, GT1 installation (scheduled Q1 2020) may be affected.

6.3 We will provide an update on programme implications once core results are available.

**7. Request**

7.1 We request that the Engineer note this notification and advise if any additional investigation is required.

7.2 DPI representatives are welcome to witness the core testing. Please contact Mr. Ondřej Malý (Quality Manager) to arrange.

7.3 We will provide the full investigation report by 10 October 2019.

We regret any concern this matter may cause and assure you that we are treating it with appropriate priority.

Yours sincerely,

**Ondřej Malý**
