Dear Dr. Braun,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DESIGN SUBMISSION - BATCH 1

We acknowledge receipt of your letter ref. SPCC/DPI/2019/0001-TEC dated 24 January 2019, together with Basic Design documents - Batch 1.

**Documents Received:**

The following documents have been received in good order:

- Design Basis Memorandum (SPCC-PR-001, Rev A)
- Process Flow Diagrams (SPCC-PR-002, Rev A)
- Heat and Mass Balance documentation (SPCC-PR-003 and -004, Rev A)
- Equipment Duty Specifications (SPCC-PR-005 to -007, Rev A)
- Performance Guarantees Calculation Basis (SPCC-PR-008, Rev A)
- Cooling Water System Design Basis (SPCC-PR-009, Rev A)

All documents have been received in both hard copy (3 sets) and electronic format (PDF).

**Review Process:**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 5.2 of the Contract, our review will be completed within 21 days from the date of receipt. The formal review comment period will therefore expire on **18 February 2019**.

The review will be conducted by:
- **Lead Reviewer:** Emilia Kowalska (DPI Technical Reviewer - Process)
- **Supporting Review:** Dr. Heinrich Weber (Engineer's Representative)
- **Quantity Surveyor Review:** Karl Hoffmann (cost implications)

A copy of this submission has been forwarded to the Employer (BEU) for their parallel review and comments.

**Review Scope:**

Our review will focus on the following key aspects:

1. **Compliance with Contract Requirements:**
   - Performance guarantees and test conditions
   - Design codes and standards
   - Technical specifications in Schedule of Technical Requirements

2. **Design Basis Adequacy:**
   - Ambient conditions and site parameters
   - Fuel specification assumptions
   - Interface definitions

3. **Technical Soundness:**
   - Heat and mass balance calculations
   - Equipment sizing and selection logic
   - Process safety considerations

4. **Coordination and Interfaces:**
   - Consistency between documents
   - Interface with Employer-supplied items
   - Interdisciplinary coordination points

**Preliminary Observations:**

Based on an initial review of the submitted documents, we note the following points which will be addressed in our formal comments:

1. **Ambient Design Conditions:** The design ambient temperature of 30°C should be verified against long-term meteorological data for the site. We will request confirmation that this represents an appropriate design point considering the performance guarantee test conditions.

2. **Fuel Gas Specification:** The assumed fuel composition should be verified against the actual gas analysis from the Bordurian national grid supply point that will serve the plant.

3. **Ground Water Assumptions:** The Design Basis Memorandum references assumed ground water levels for foundation design. These will need to be confirmed by the ground investigation, which we understand is scheduled to commence shortly.

These preliminary observations are provided to give SPCC early awareness of potential areas requiring attention. Our formal review comments will be issued by 18 February 2019 and may include additional matters.

**Next Batches:**

We note from your design deliverables schedule that Batch 2 (Civil and Structural) is planned for submission on 5 February 2019. Please ensure that submissions are complete and of adequate quality to allow efficient review. Incomplete or poor-quality submissions may result in extended review periods or rejection of the submission.

Should you require any clarification regarding our review process or the preliminary observations noted above, please do not hesitate to contact me or Ms. Kowalska.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Heinrich Weber**  
Engineer's Representative  
Dobrić & Partners International
