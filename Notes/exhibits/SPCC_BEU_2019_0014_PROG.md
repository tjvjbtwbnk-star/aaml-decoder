**Subject: Monthly Progress Report - April 2019**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 4.21 (Progress Reports)**

Dear Ms. Petrović,

In accordance with Sub-Clause 4.21 of the Contract, please find enclosed the Monthly Progress Report for April 2019.

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Reporting Period:** 1 - 30 April 2019

**Overall Status:** The project continues to progress, with good momentum in earthworks and site establishment activities. However, design approval delays and the contaminated soil discovery are impacting the overall schedule. Recovery measures are being implemented.

| Metric | This Month | Cumulative |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Planned Progress | 4.0% | 4.0% |
| Actual Progress | 3.6% | 3.6% |
| Variance | -0.4% | -0.4% |
| SPI | 0.90 | 0.90 |

**2. KEY ACHIEVEMENTS**

- NE site area access resolved (2 April)
- EPA approval obtained for contaminated soil remediation (23 April)
- Basic Design Batch 1 approved (12 April)
- Earthworks progressing ahead of target in accessible areas
- Civil works subcontractor (BCC) mobilised (29 April)
- First piling rig operational (2 May - post period)

**3. KEY ISSUES**

- Basic Design approval delayed (target was 15 April)
- Contaminated soil conditions requiring remediation (GT1 area)
- GT1 foundation redesign required
- HRSG engineering schedule slippage identified

**4. PROGRESS BY DISCIPLINE**

**4.1 Engineering & Design**

| Package | Planned % | Actual % | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Basic Design | 100% | 75% | Behind - Batch 2,3,4 under review |
| Detailed Design | 15% | 8% | Behind - awaiting Basic Design |

Comment: Design progress impacted by extended review cycles and ground conditions issue.

**4.2 Procurement**

| Package | Status | Delivery |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Gas Turbines | Manufacturing | Mar/May 2020 |
| Steam Turbine | Manufacturing | Sep 2020 |
| HRSG | Engineering (delayed) | Nov 2020/Jan 2021 |
| Main Transformer | Contract signed | Aug 2020 |

Comment: HRSG engineering 3 weeks behind; monitoring closely.

**4.3 Construction**

| Activity | Planned % | Actual % | Status |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Site Establishment | 100% | 100% | Complete |
| Earthworks | 55% | 62% | Ahead |
| Piling | 5% | 0% | Behind (started 2 May) |
| Foundations | 0% | 0% | On programme |

Comment: Earthworks ahead of programme in accessible areas. Piling commenced post-period end.

**5. PROGRAMME STATUS**

**5.1 Milestone Status**

| Milestone | Contractual | Forecast | Variance |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Basic Design Approval | 15 Apr 2019 | 12 Jun 2019 | +58 days |
| Foundation Completion | 01 Sep 2019 | 15 Nov 2019 | +75 days |
| GT1 Delivery | 01 Mar 2020 | 01 Mar 2020 | 0 days |
| Mechanical Completion | 15 Jul 2022 | TBD | TBD |
| Taking Over | 14 Jan 2023 | TBD | TBD |

**5.2 Critical Path**

Current critical path: Design Approval → GT Procurement → GT Delivery → GT Installation → Commissioning → Taking Over

Emerging risk: GT1 foundation may become critical if remediation/redesign extends beyond current estimates.
