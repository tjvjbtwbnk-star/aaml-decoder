**Subject: Review Comments on Basic Design Documents - Batch 2 Rev A (Civil/Structural)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 5.2 (Contractor's Documents); Your Ref: SPCC/DPI/2019/0003-TEC dated 22 April 2019**

Dear Dr. Braun,

**1. DOCUMENTS REVIEWED**

We have completed review of the Basic Design Documents - Batch 2 Rev A (Civil/Structural) submitted on 22 April 2019. This letter provides our review comments in accordance with Sub-Clause 5.2 of the Contract.

**2. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS**

2.1 The quality of the resubmission has improved significantly compared to the original submission. The majority of our previous comments have been adequately addressed.

2.2 We note that documents BCCPP-CV-013 (GT1 Foundation Design) and the associated responses to Comments A-07 and A-11 are not included in this submission, pending resolution of ground conditions. This is acknowledged and accepted.

2.3 Several minor clarifications are required before approval can be granted.

**3. COMMENT SUMMARY**

| Category | Original Comments | Closed | New Comments | Outstanding |
|----------|------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| A (Major) | 12 | 10 | 0 | 2 (held for GT1) |
| B (Minor) | 28 | 28 | 3 | 3 |
| C (Observations) | 12 | 12 | 5 | 5 |
| **Total** | **52** | **50** | **8** | **10** |

**4. NEW COMMENTS**

The following new comments have arisen from review of the revised documents:

**Category B (Minor) - Require Resolution Before Approval:**

| Ref | Document | Comment |
|-----|----------|---------|
| B-53 | BCCPP-CV-002 | Site grading plan shows finished floor levels for Admin Building that differ from architectural drawings by 150mm. Please confirm correct level and revise accordingly. |
| B-54 | BCCPP-CV-008 | Underground utilities layout shows cable duct crossing piled foundation zone in HRSG area. Please confirm clash-free routing or demonstrate acceptable interface. |
| B-55 | BCCPP-CV-011 | Main building steel framing connection details reference design code EC3, but load combinations appear to follow American AISC practice. Please clarify design code basis and ensure consistency. |

**Category C (Observations) - For Information/Incorporation in Detailed Design:**

| Ref | Document | Comment |
|-----|----------|---------|
| C-61 | BCCPP-CV-003 | Earthworks design should note requirement for compaction testing frequency (suggested 1 per 500 m³). |
| C-62 | BCCPP-CV-004 | Piling layout should indicate minimum pile spacing to avoid group effects. |
| C-63 | BCCPP-CV-006 | HRSG foundation design references 8m pile length but geotechnical report suggests 10m may be required in some locations. Please verify during detailed design. |
| C-64 | BCCPP-CV-009 | Drainage design should confirm outlet capacity is adequate for 1-in-100 year storm event. |
| C-65 | BCCPP-CV-012 | Geotechnical design report should include recommendations for foundation construction monitoring (e.g., pile integrity testing). |

**5. OUTSTANDING COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS REVIEW**

Comments A-07 and A-11 remain outstanding, held pending GT1 foundation design submission. These must be resolved before full Batch 2 approval can be granted.

**6. REVIEW OUTCOME**

Based on this review, the Batch 2 Rev A submission is classified as:

**COMMENTS - RESUBMISSION REQUIRED (Code C)**

The Contractor is required to address Comments B-53, B-54, and B-55 and resubmit the affected documents for approval.

Comments C-61 to C-65 are observations that should be incorporated in the Detailed Design phase and do not prevent approval of the Basic Design.

**7. RESPONSE REQUIRED**

7.1 Please provide responses to Comments B-53, B-54, and B-55 within 14 days of this letter (i.e., by 17 May 2019).

7.2 Revised documents should be submitted as Batch 2 Rev B.

7.3 Upon satisfactory resolution of the Category B comments, and subject to subsequent resolution of A-07 and A-11 for GT1, approval will be granted.

**8. PROGRAMME IMPACT**

8.1 We note the Contractor's concern regarding design approval timeline.

8.2 To assist progress, we confirm that the approved portions of Batch 2 (specifically, documents BCCPP-CV-005, BCCPP-CV-006, BCCPP-CV-007, and BCCPP-CV-012, subject to comments above) provide sufficient basis for the Contractor to proceed with piling works in the Admin Building, HRSG, and Cooling Tower areas.

8.3 This partial approval is granted to avoid unnecessary delay to construction activities while the remaining comments are resolved.

We remain available to discuss any aspects of these comments and to provide clarification as required.

Yours sincerely,
