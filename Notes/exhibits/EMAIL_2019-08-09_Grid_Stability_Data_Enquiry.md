**Subject:** Grid Stability Data - Status Enquiry
---

Dear Stefan,

I hope you are well. I am writing to follow up on our discussion at the Design Task Force meeting on Tuesday regarding the grid connection data.

**Background**

As you know, the detailed electrical design for the BCCPP requires grid stability data from the TSO (Borduria Grid Operator) to finalise several critical design elements. This data was originally requested in March 2019 with an expected delivery in June 2019.

**Current Status**

According to our records, the following data remains outstanding:

| Data Item | Required For | Request Date | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Grid fault level at 400kV connection point | Protection relay settings | 15 Mar 2019 | Outstanding |
| Grid impedance characteristics | Harmonic filter design | 15 Mar 2019 | Outstanding |
| System frequency variation data | Governor settings | 15 Mar 2019 | Outstanding |
| Grid voltage profile (operating range) | AVR settings | 15 Mar 2019 | Outstanding |
| Protection coordination requirements | GT protection scheme | 28 May 2019 | Outstanding |

**Impact on Detailed Design**

Without this data, we cannot finalise the following design packages:

1. **Protection System Design** (~15% of electrical scope)
   - Generator protection relay settings
   - Transformer protection coordination
   - Grid interface protection

2. **Power Quality Equipment** (~5% of electrical scope)
   - Harmonic filter sizing and configuration
   - Reactive power compensation

3. **Control System Interfaces** (~8% of electrical scope)
   - Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) parameters
   - Governor control settings
   - Grid code compliance logic

**Current Assumptions**

To maintain design progress, we have proceeded with assumed values based on typical parameters for the Bordurian grid. These assumptions are documented in our Design Basis Report (DD-REP-ELE-001 Section 5.3).

However, if the actual grid parameters differ significantly from our assumptions, design rework will be required. In the worst case, this could affect equipment specifications and procurement.

**Specific Concerns**

I am particularly concerned about the protection coordination requirements. TurboMach has requested confirmation of the GT protection scheme by 31 August 2019 to complete their control system software. Without the grid data, we cannot finalise this scheme.

If the protection scheme changes after TurboMach has completed their software, there will be additional costs and potential programme delays for GT commissioning.

**Request**

Could you please provide an update on:

1. Expected date for receipt of grid stability data from TSO
2. Any interim data that may be available
3. Whether BEU can expedite the request given the programme criticality

I understand that obtaining data from the TSO is outside SPCC's direct control. However, under the Contract, the Employer is responsible for procuring necessary data from third parties (Sub-Clause 1.9).

If the data cannot be provided by 22 August 2019, I would recommend that we submit a formal notice under Sub-Clause 1.9 to protect the Contractor's position regarding any resulting delays or costs.

I am available to discuss this by phone or in a meeting at your convenience. Dragan mentioned at the last Design Task Force that he was following up with the TSO – any update from that would be appreciated.

Best regards,
