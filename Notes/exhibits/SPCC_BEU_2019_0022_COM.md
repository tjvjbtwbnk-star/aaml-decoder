**Subject: Response to Employer's VO-003 Position**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; BEU/SPCC/2019/0017-COM dated 16 July 2019; Our refs. SPCC/BEU/2019/0019-COM and 0021-COM**

Dear Mrs. Nikolić,

We refer to your letter of 16 July 2019 setting out the Employer's position on entitlement and quantum in respect of DE-003 (Cooling System Modification). We have carefully reviewed the Employer's assessment and provide our response below.

**1. Acknowledgement of Entitlement**

1.1 We welcome the Employer's acceptance that the instruction of 5 June 2019 constitutes a Variation under Sub-Clause 13.1 and that the Contractor is entitled to adjustment of the Contract Price and Extension of Time.

1.2 This acceptance is consistent with our position and the proper operation of the Contract. We appreciate the Employer's pragmatic approach in seeking to reach a commercial resolution.

**2. Response to Cost Assessment**

2.1 We do not accept that the Employer's cost assessment of EUR 17,450,000 fairly reflects the reasonable additional cost of complying with the instruction. We address each item below.

**2.2 Hybrid Cooling Tower Supply (EUR 8,450,000 claimed vs EUR 7,200,000 assessed)**

The Employer suggests our claim includes items within the original scope. This is incorrect. The CoolTech quotation is specifically for the differential scope between the original wet cooling tower and the hybrid system. We enclose:

- Enclosure 1: CoolTech breakdown showing original vs hybrid scope
- Enclosure 2: Reconciliation demonstrating no double-counting

The EUR 7,200,000 figure understates the actual supply cost difference by EUR 1,250,000. CoolTech's quotation is a firm budgetary price valid until 17 August 2019.

**2.3 Design Development (EUR 2,180,000 claimed vs EUR 1,450,000 assessed)**

The Employer's assessment of EUR 1,450,000 does not reflect the actual engineering effort required:

- The hybrid system requires substantially different process design parameters
- Control system integration is more complex than for a simple wet system
- Interface coordination with existing designs is extensive
- Third-party reviews are essential given the technical novelty

We note that CoolTech's design support alone is EUR 480,000 (per their quotation), leaving only EUR 970,000 in the Employer's assessment for all internal resources, other external support, and contingency. This is not realistic.

We maintain that EUR 2,180,000 is reasonable and conservative.

**2.4 Civil Works Modifications (EUR 4,250,000 claimed vs EUR 3,100,000 assessed)**

The Employer's objection relates primarily to the 12% contingency. We submit that:

- At this preliminary design stage, contingency is essential
- The actual scope may increase as design develops
- Industry norms for early-stage estimates support 10-15% contingency

We would be prepared to accept a mechanism whereby contingency is adjusted based on actual outturn costs, but cannot accept its elimination at this stage.

**2.5 Prolongation Costs (EUR 1,650,000 claimed vs EUR 850,000 assessed)**

This item is directly linked to the EOT determination. The Employer's assessment assumes 45 days EOT; ours assumes 85 days. We address the time entitlement in Section 3 below.

**3. Response to Time Assessment**

3.1 We do not accept the Employer's assessment of 45 calendar days Extension of Time. This significantly underestimates the critical path impact of the cooling system modification.

**3.2 Design Dependencies**

The Employer suggests greater parallelisation is achievable. However:

- Process design parameters must be established before detailed mechanical, civil, electrical and I&C design can proceed beyond preliminary stage
- This sequential dependency is fundamental to sound engineering practice
- Attempting greater parallelisation would result in significant abortive work and rework costs

We enclose (Enclosure 3) a detailed design dependency analysis demonstrating the critical sequential elements.

**3.3 Procurement Timeline**

The Employer suggests earlier provisional ordering could reduce the impact. However:

- Provisional ordering carries commercial risk until variation agreement is reached
- CoolTech requires technical parameters to be confirmed before manufacturing
- The 14-week lead time extension is CoolTech's assessed minimum with expedited manufacturing

**3.4 Mitigation Measures**

We have incorporated substantial mitigation in our assessment:

- Additional design resources engaged
- Parallel working maximised within technical constraints
- Expedited manufacturing with CoolTech (premium paid)
- Foundation works re-sequenced where possible

Without these measures, our analysis shows the impact would exceed 110 days. The 85-day claim represents a mitigated duration.

**3.5 Revised EOT Assessment**

Having reviewed the Employer's comments, we have undertaken further analysis and can refine our claim as follows:

| Activity | Original Claim | Revised Assessment |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Design development | 84 days (12 weeks) | 77 days (11 weeks) |
| Procurement lead time extension | 98 days (14 weeks) | 91 days (13 weeks) |
| Construction works extension | 35 days | 28 days |
| **Gross Impact** | **217 days** | **196 days** |
| Less: Parallelisation | (100 days) | (112 days) |
| Less: Mitigation | (32 days) | (14 days) |
| **Net Critical Path Impact** | **85 days** | **70 days** |

We are prepared to revise our claim to **70 calendar days** Extension of Time.

**4. Foreseeability**

4.1 We note the Employer's comments regarding foreseeability at paragraph 5 of your letter. We fundamentally disagree with any suggestion that this change was foreseeable.

4.2 Regulation No. 2019/127 was enacted on 15 March 2019, well after Contract award and commencement. The specific requirements (thermal discharge limit of 3°C ΔT, plume abatement) could not reasonably have been anticipated.

4.3 General awareness of regulatory trends does not equate to specific foreseeability of detailed technical requirements.

4.4 We reserve our position on this point but note the Employer has not pursued it and we agree this is the appropriate approach in the interests of a commercial resolution.

**5. Counter-Proposal**

5.1 In the spirit of reaching prompt agreement, we propose the following:

| Item | Amount/Duration |
|------|-----------------|
| Additional Cost | EUR 20,500,000 |
| Extension of Time | 70 calendar days |
| Revised Completion Date | 25 March 2023 |

5.2 This represents a material reduction from our original claim in the interests of resolution:

| | Original Claim | Counter-Proposal | Reduction |
|--|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| Cost | EUR 22,300,000 | EUR 20,500,000 | EUR 1,800,000 (8%) |
| Time | 85 days | 70 days | 15 days (18%) |

**6. Meeting**

6.1 We accept the Employer's invitation to meet and propose Tuesday 23 July 2019 at 10:00 at the SPCC Site Office.

6.2 Our attendees will be:
- Mr. Miroslav Horák, Project Manager
- Mr. Jiří Procházka, Commercial Manager
- Dr. Wilhelm Braun, Engineering Manager (subject to return from Zürich)

6.3 We suggest the agenda focus on:
- Technical justification for design and construction durations
- Commercial reconciliation of cost items
- Mechanism for managing contingency
- CoolTech ordering arrangements

**7. Interim Measures**

7.1 We confirm that design work is proceeding as instructed, notwithstanding the commercial uncertainty.

7.2 We note the Employer's willingness to consider an interim payment for design costs incurred. We will submit an interim application with supporting documentation by 26 July 2019.

7.3 Given the CoolTech quotation validity (17 August 2019) and manufacturing lead times, we urge the Employer to reach agreement no later than 31 July 2019 to preserve the programme.

We remain committed to resolving this matter promptly and look forward to productive discussions on 23 July.

Yours sincerely,

**Jiří Procházka**
