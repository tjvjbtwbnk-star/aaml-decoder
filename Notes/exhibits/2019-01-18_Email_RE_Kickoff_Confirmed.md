**From:** Ivana Petrović <i.petrovic@beu.bd>  
**To:** Miroslav Horák <m.horak@spcc-jv.com>  
**Cc:** Dr. Miloš Vladić <m.vladic@beu.bd>; Tomáš Králík <t.kralik@spcc-jv.com>; Dr. Heinrich Weber <h.weber@dpi.at>  
**Date:** 18 January 2019, 10:22  
**Subject:** RE: Proposed kick-off meeting agenda - confirmed

Dear Miroslav,

Thank you for your comprehensive agenda proposal. This looks excellent and covers all the key items we need to address at the kick-off.

I can confirm the following arrangements:

**Meeting Details:**
- **Date:** Monday, 21 January 2019
- **Time:** 09:00 - 14:00
- **Venue:** BEU Head Office, Conference Room 3A (Third Floor)
  - Address: 42 Boulevard Marshal Douma, Szohôd
- **Parking:** Visitor parking available in rear courtyard - please check in at main reception desk

The agenda is approved as proposed. We will arrange catering for the working lunch (please let me know if anyone in your group has specific dietary requirements).

**BEU Attendees:**
- Dr. Miloš Vladić (Project Director)
- Ivana Petrović (Project Manager)
- Dragan Kostić (Technical Manager)
- Ana Nikolić (Contracts Administrator)
- Dejan Ilić (HSE Manager)
- Stefan Jovanović (Electrical Engineer)
- Branko Simić (Site Representative)

We are pleased that Dr. Weber will be attending. I have copied him on this email. His participation will indeed be valuable in establishing our working procedures.

Please send me your final attendee list by Friday 18 January (close of business) so we can prepare building access passes. All attendees will need to bring photo identification.

One small addition to the agenda: Under Item 4 (Site Handover), could we also briefly discuss the ground investigation programme that will need to be conducted? I understand from preliminary discussions that SPCC will be proposing a scope, and it would be helpful to align on the approach.

Looking forward to meeting you and your team on Monday.

Best regards,

**Ivana Petrović**
