- Site roads improved and access routes graded
- Additional site lighting installed
- Emergency assembly point and first aid station established

**Current Site Status:**
- Personnel on site: 18 SPCC staff (up from 12 last week)
- Site establishment approximately 85% complete
- All essential facilities now operational
- Site ready for ground investigation commencement

**TP** noted that some minor landscaping and finishing work remains but this will not impede operations.

**BS** conducted informal site inspection yesterday and confirmed good progress. Site is well-organized and HSE standards appear good.

## 3. HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT

**PH** provided HSE report:

**Incidents/Near Misses:**
- Zero incidents this week
- One near-miss reported: Delivery truck reversed without banksman on 11 Feb. Driver counselled, toolbox talk on vehicle movements conducted 12 Feb.

**HSE Activities:**
- Daily toolbox talks conducted (topics: winter working, vehicle safety, manual handling)
- Weekly HSE inspection completed 12 Feb - no significant findings
- Site induction: 6 new personnel inducted this week (cumulative: 18 people)
- First aid training refresher for site personnel scheduled 20 Feb

**Environmental:**
- Waste segregation working well (minimal waste generation at this stage)
- No community complaints
- No environmental incidents
- Dust and noise levels minimal

**Upcoming:**
- Drilling contractor (Balkan Geotechnical) HSE plan review and approval
- Drilling operations HSE briefing planned for 18 Feb before commencement

**MS** commented that site HSE standards appear very good. She will conduct independent HSE inspection next week.

## 4. GROUND INVESTIGATION - NE AREA ACCESS

**Critical Issue:** Access to northeastern area for drilling operations.

**BS** provided update:
- Matter still under negotiation between BEU legal and Klow Chemical Works
- Progress has been made but no final resolution yet
- BEU cannot confirm access will be available by 18 Feb (planned drilling start)

**Discussion:** This creates a significant issue as the drilling contractor is ready to mobilise 18 Feb and has allocated equipment and personnel specifically for this project.

**PN** outlined SPCC's concerns:
- Drilling contractor mobilisation is time-sensitive and expensive to reschedule
- Ground investigation is on near-critical path (results needed by end March for foundation design)
- Cannot complete full investigation without accessing NE area (6 boreholes located there)

**Options Discussed:**

**Option 1:** Proceed with accessible boreholes only (18 out of 24) and defer NE area drilling
- **Pros:** Can maintain 18 Feb start, keeps contractor engaged
- **Cons:** Incomplete investigation, may need separate mobilisation later (costly), programme risk

**Option 2:** Delay entire investigation until NE access resolved
- **Pros:** Complete investigation in one mobilisation
- **Cons:** Programme delay, contractor demobilisation/remobilisation costs, impacts foundation design schedule

**Option 3:** Temporary access arrangement with Klow Chemical Works for drilling only
- **Pros:** Allows complete investigation on schedule
- **Cons:** Requires agreement from Klow Chemical Works specifically for drilling access

**BS** suggested Option 3 may be possible. He will contact Klow Chemical Works directly today to request temporary access specifically for drilling (estimated 5 working days in that area, with proper site safety and insurance arrangements).

**Decision:** SPCC will proceed with Option 1 (drill accessible areas first) starting 18 Feb. This gives BEU 2-3 weeks to secure temporary access to NE area while drilling continues elsewhere on site. If NE access is not available by early March, the drilling contractor will need to demobilise and return later at additional cost.

**PN** noted that if Option 1 results in two separate mobilisations due to access issues, SPCC will be submitting a claim under Sub-Clause 2.1 (Right of Access to Site) for the additional costs and any resultant programme delay.

**Action: BS to contact Klow Chemical Works today regarding temporary drilling access (BS - by 14 Feb).**

**Action: SPCC to document costs of two-mobilisation scenario for potential claim (PN/JS - by 20 Feb).**

**MS** noted this issue should be formally notified by SPCC if it is considered to constitute a Clause 2.1 event.

## 5. DESIGN STATUS AND REVIEW COMMENTS

**WB** joined the meeting at 11:00 to discuss design matters.

**Basic Design Batch 1 - Review Comments:**

**WB** reported that SPCC received Engineer's review comments yesterday (DPI letter ref. DPI/SPCC/2019/0002 dated 12 Feb) containing 74 comments (16 major, 40 minor, 18 observations).

SPCC is reviewing the comments in detail. Some comments require input from BEU or clarification of Employer's Requirements. Technical coordination meeting scheduled for this afternoon (14:00) to discuss.

**WB** noted that several major comments relate to matters that BEU has already clarified in letter BEU/SPCC/2019/0003-TEC (8 Feb), so there should be good alignment.

Target for revised submission: 5 March per Engineer's requirement.

**Basic Design Batch 2 - Civil and Structural:**

Submission delayed from 8 Feb to 15 Feb due to additional detailing work required. Submission will occur Friday 15 Feb.

**BS** asked if delay to Batch 2 impacts programme. **JS** confirmed it does not - the 21-day review period still allows approval by mid-April as required. The delay was to ensure higher quality submission and avoid excessive review comments.

**Basic Design Batch 3 - Mechanical Systems:**

On track for submission 18 February (slight acceleration from original 15 Feb plan).

**Basic Design Batch 4 - Electrical:**

On track for submission 25 February.

- Manufacturing proceeding on schedule
- Factory design review meeting scheduled March 2019 in Winterthur, Switzerland
- SPCC delegation will include engineering and QA personnel

**HRSGs (CoolTech Systems):**
- Engineering progressing
- Waiting for finalized process data from SPCC (dependent on Basic Design approval)

**Generators (Sildavo Electrical Works):**
- Contract negotiations progressing
- Some commercial issues remaining
- Target contract signature end February

**Civil Works Subcontractor:**
- Tender documents in preparation
- Plan to issue tenders 20 February

## 7. PROGRAMME

**JS** provided programme update:

**Current Status:** On schedule overall, but NE area access issue creates risk.

**Key Activities This Week:**
- Site mobilisation (ongoing, 85% complete)
- Ground investigation preparation
- Design submissions and reviews

**Next 2 Weeks:**
- Ground investigation commencement (18 Feb)
- Basic Design Batch 2 submission (15 Feb)
- Basic Design Batch 3 submission (18 Feb)
- Technical coordination meetings on design
- Ground investigation drilling (18 Feb - 15 Mar)

**Critical Path:** Currently runs through design approvals (target mid-April). NE area access could become critical if ground investigation is significantly delayed.

**Weather Impact:** No significant weather delays. Temperatures have been around 0-5°C, which is manageable for current activities.

**MS** asked about programme contingency. **JS** confirmed there is approximately 15 days of float to the foundation design approval milestone, but this could be consumed if ground investigation is delayed.

---

## 8. QUALITY

**PN** reported that Project Quality Plan is being finalized and will be submitted Friday 15 Feb as committed.

For ground investigation, specific Inspection and Test Plans will be prepared covering drilling procedures, sampling, and laboratory testing.

---

## 9. COMMERCIAL MATTERS

**PN** noted:
- January payment application submitted 12 Feb (value approximately EUR 845,000 - mobilisation costs)
- First substantial payment will be February application (covering ground investigation and continued mobilisation)
- No variations or claims submitted to date
- NE area access issue may result in claim if not resolved promptly (see Item 4)
