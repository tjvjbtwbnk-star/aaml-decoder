# EMAIL

**From:** Dr. Wilhelm Braun <w.braun@spcc-jv.com>  
**To:** Dragan Kostić <d.kostic@beu.bd>  
**Cc:** Miroslav Horák <m.horak@spcc-jv.com>; Dr. Heinrich Weber <h.weber@dpi.at>; Ivana Petrović <i.petrovic@beu.bd>  
**Date:** 23 January 2019, 16:45  
**Subject:** Design deliverables schedule - initial proposal

Dear Dragan,

Further to the kick-off meeting discussions on Monday, please find attached our proposed schedule for submission of Basic Design documents. This schedule is aligned with our preliminary programme and will allow us to maintain the target approval date of mid-April 2019.

**Basic Design Submission Schedule:**

**Batch 1 - Process and Performance (Target: 24 January)**
- Design Basis Memorandum
- Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs)
- Heat and Mass Balance
- Equipment Duty Specifications
- Performance Guarantees Calculation Basis

**Batch 2 - Civil and Structural (Target: 5 February)**
- Site Layout Plans
- Grading and Drainage Design
- Foundation Design Drawings (subject to ground investigation results)
- Structural Steel Calculations and Drawings - Main Buildings
- Architectural Layouts

**Batch 3 - Mechanical Systems (Target: 15 February)**
- Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) - All systems
- Equipment Arrangement Drawings
- Major Equipment Specifications (HRSGs, Steam Turbine, Cooling System)
- Piping Design and Support Calculations
- HVAC Design for Buildings

**Batch 4 - Electrical and Control Systems (Target: 25 February)**
- Single Line Diagrams - HV and MV Systems
- Electrical Load List and Power Distribution Philosophy
- Switchyard Layout and Equipment Specifications
- Control System Architecture
- Instrumentation List and Datasheets

Each batch will be submitted to DPI for review with copy to BEU. We understand the 21-day review period will commence from the date of receipt by DPI.

A few points for discussion:

1. **Ground Investigation Impact**: The foundation design in Batch 2 is necessarily preliminary pending the ground investigation results. We propose to submit foundation design based on assumed parameters from the available geotechnical data, with a commitment to revise once the investigation is complete. This approach will allow the Engineer to review our general approach and identify any concerns early.

2. **Parallel Reviews**: To optimize the schedule, we propose that DPI and BEU review batches in parallel where possible. This will help us achieve the mid-April approval target for the complete Basic Design package.

3. **Design Interface Register**: We will submit a Design Interface Register alongside Batch 1 to track interdisciplinary coordination points. This will be a living document updated throughout the design phase.

4. **Vendor Data**: Some vendor technical data (particularly for the gas turbines and HRSGs) will be submitted as it becomes available from TurboMach and CoolTech. This will be clearly identified in our submittals.

Could you please confirm if this schedule and approach are acceptable? We are ready to submit Batch 1 tomorrow (24 January) if you are comfortable with the proposed structure.

I would also welcome the opportunity to have a brief technical coordination call with you and Heinrich to ensure we're fully aligned on the review process and any specific areas of focus.

Best regards,
