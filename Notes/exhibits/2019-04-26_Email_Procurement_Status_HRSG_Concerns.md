**Subject:** Procurement Status Report - Concerns on HRSG Schedule
---

Dear Tomáš,

As requested, I am providing an update on procurement status for the major equipment packages ahead of PMM-004 on Monday. I want to flag some concerns on the HRSG procurement that require management attention.

**PROCUREMENT STATUS SUMMARY:**

| Package | Supplier | Contract Value | Status | Delivery |
|---------|----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Gas Turbines (2x) | TurboMach AG | EUR 198M | Manufacturing | Mar/May 2020 |
| Steam Turbine | TurboMach AG | EUR 62M | Manufacturing | Sep 2020 |
| HRSG (2x) | CoolTech GmbH | EUR 78M | Engineering | Nov 2020/Jan 2021 |
| Main Transformer | Sildavo Electrical | EUR 8.5M | Final negotiation | Aug 2020 |
| Generator | Sildavo Electrical | EUR 24M | Manufactured | Jul 2020 |
| Cooling Tower | CoolTech GmbH | EUR 18M | Engineering | Mar 2021 |

**GAS TURBINES (TurboMach AG):**

Manufacturing is progressing well at the Zürich facility. I attended the monthly progress meeting on 15 April:

- GT1: Compressor section complete, combustion system assembly in progress
- GT2: Compressor section 80% complete
- Factory Acceptance Test GT1: Scheduled 15-19 July 2019
- Factory Acceptance Test GT2: Scheduled 9-13 September 2019
- Delivery dates confirmed: GT1 - March 2020, GT2 - May 2020

No concerns at this stage. TurboMach is a reliable supplier with excellent track record.

**HRSG (CoolTech GmbH) - CONCERN:**

This is where I need to flag a concern. During my visit to CoolTech's engineering office in Munich last week, I observed the following:

1. **Engineering Progress:** Detailed engineering is running approximately 3 weeks behind the contractual schedule. CoolTech cites resource constraints and the complexity of coordinating with the GT interface requirements.

2. **Module Fabrication:** The first fabrication packages (economiser modules) were due to be released to their Korean fabrication partner (Doosan) by 15 April. This has slipped to mid-May.

3. **Steel Procurement:** CoolTech is experiencing delays in securing alloy steel plate for the high-pressure drum. Lead times have extended from 16 weeks to 22 weeks due to market conditions.

4. **Potential Delivery Impact:** CoolTech's project manager (Herr Müller) acknowledged that the current HRSG1 delivery date of November 2020 is "at risk" and a 4-6 week delay is possible.

**Risk Assessment:**

The HRSG delivery is not currently on the critical path (GT installation and commissioning drives the schedule). However, if GT1 installation proceeds as planned and HRSG1 is delayed, we could face a situation where the GT is ready but cannot be commissioned due to HRSG unavailability.

Current programme float between GT1 ready and HRSG1 required: approximately 8 weeks. If HRSG slips 6 weeks, float reduces to 2 weeks, which is uncomfortably tight.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Issue formal letter to CoolTech requesting recovery programme and expressing concern about schedule
2. Increase monitoring frequency (monthly site visits to Munich and Korea)
3. Consider early procurement of critical long-lead materials (alloy steel) directly by SPCC to de-risk supply
4. Review contractual remedies (LDs for late delivery)

I recommend we discuss this at the management meeting on Monday before PMM-004.

**OTHER PACKAGES:**

- **Main Transformer:** Contract negotiations with Sildavo Electrical are progressing. Final price agreed at EUR 8.5M. Contract signature expected next week.

- **Generator:** Already manufactured and in storage at Sildavo's facility in Klow. No concerns.

- **Cooling Tower:** Engineering proceeding on schedule. Note that this package is linked to the cooling system change (DE-003) which remains unresolved.

Please let me know if you need any additional information before Monday.

Best regards,
