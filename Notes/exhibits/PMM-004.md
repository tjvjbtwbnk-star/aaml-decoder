## Minutes

### 1. Review of Previous Minutes and Actions

Minutes of PMM-003 dated 25 March 2019 were approved without amendment.

**Action Review:**

| Action | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| PMM-003/01: Submit Baseline Programme Rev 1 | M. Dvořák | Complete |
| PMM-003/02: Resolve NE site access | I. Petrović | Complete |
| PMM-003/03: Issue ground conditions response | D. Kostić | Complete - EPA approved |
| PMM-003/04: Provide civil works tender evaluation | P. Novotný | Complete - BCC awarded |

### 2. Executive Summary - Project Status

T. Králík presented the executive summary:

**Overall Assessment:** Project is progressing but facing challenges from ground conditions discovery and design review timelines. Recovery measures are being implemented.

**Key Metrics (as at 26 April 2019):**

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Earned Value | 3.6% | ↑ |
| Schedule Performance Index | 0.87 | ↓ |
| Cost Performance Index | 0.98 | → |
| Days Behind Programme | 8 days | ↑ |
| Float Remaining | 7 days | ↓ |
| LTI Frequency Rate | 0.0 | → |

Dr. M. Vladić expressed concern about the schedule erosion and requested a clear path to recovery. He emphasised that delay liquidated damages of EUR 425,000 per day make schedule recovery a commercial imperative.

T. Králík acknowledged the concerns and confirmed SPCC is committed to recovery. He noted that significant factors affecting progress (site access, ground conditions) were Employer risk events for which SPCC has entitlement claims.

### 3. Design Progress and Basic Design Approval

Dr. W. Braun presented design status:

**Basic Design Milestone:**

The contractual milestone for Basic Design Approval (15 April 2019) was not achieved. Current status:

| Batch | Status | Forecast Approval |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Batch 1 | Approved 12 April | Complete |
| Batch 2 Rev A | Submitted 22 April; under review | 17 May |
| Batch 3 | Comments being addressed | 24 May |
| Batch 4 | Comments being addressed | 31 May |

**Forecast Full Basic Design Approval: 12 June 2019 (+58 days from contractual date)**

I. Petrović stated that BEU considers the design approval delay to be primarily attributable to the quality of SPCC's initial submissions, which required multiple review cycles.

Dr. W. Braun responded that while SPCC accepts some responsibility for comment resolution, the review durations exceeded contractual periods in several instances, and the ground conditions discovery necessitated design holds that were beyond SPCC's control.

Dr. H. Weber noted the Engineer's position: design review has been thorough and necessary to ensure quality. Some delays arose from submission quality, some from the ground conditions issue. A balanced assessment is warranted.

**GT1 Foundation Redesign:**

TCM-002 to be held this afternoon (29 April) to evaluate alternative foundation solutions. Decision expected by end of week.

**Action:** PMM-004/01 - Parties to confirm GT1 foundation solution at TCM-002 | Due: 29 April 2019

### 4. Construction Progress

P. Novotný presented construction progress:

**Earthworks:**
- Admin Building excavation: 95% complete (formation level reached in main area)
- Cooling Tower excavation: 40% complete
- NE Area preparation: 60% complete
- Overall earthworks: 62% complete

**Civil Works Subcontractor:**
- BCC mobilised to site 29 April
- Site induction completed for 28 personnel
- First piling rig operational 2 May
- Initial piling: Admin Building area (24 piles)

**Contamination Remediation:**
- BEU specification received 25 April
- SPCC methodology submission in preparation (due 2 May)
- Remediation works targeted to commence 13 May

M. Santos confirmed that site work quality has been good. Earthworks are proceeding efficiently in unaffected areas.

B. Simić reported no issues with BCC coordination. The subcontractor appears well-organised.

### 5. Procurement Status

F. Kučera presented procurement status:

**Major Equipment Summary:**

| Package | Status | Risk Level |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Gas Turbines | On schedule | Low |
| Steam Turbine | On schedule | Low |
| HRSG | Engineering delayed 3 weeks | Medium |
| Main Transformer | Contract signature imminent | Low |
| Generator | Complete (in storage) | Low |
| Cooling Tower | Subject to DE-003 resolution | High |

**HRSG Concern:**

F. Kučera highlighted concerns about CoolTech's engineering progress and potential delivery delay of 4-6 weeks.

Dr. M. Vladić requested that formal correspondence be issued to CoolTech expressing concern and requiring a recovery programme.

T. Králík confirmed SPCC would issue a warning letter and increase monitoring.

**Action:** PMM-004/02 - F. Kučera to issue formal letter to CoolTech on schedule concerns | Due: 3 May 2019

### 6. Programme Review and Recovery Measures

M. Dvořák presented the programme analysis and recovery measures:

**Current Delay Analysis:**

| Delay Factor | Days | Attribution |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| Design review extended duration | 3 | Shared |
| NE site access (DE-001) | 2 | Employer risk |
| Ground conditions (DE-002) | 3 | Employer risk |
| **Total** | **8** | |

**Recovery Programme:**

SPCC proposes the following measures to recover the 8-day delay:

| Measure | Recovery (days) | Implementation |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Extended working hours (10-hr shifts) | 3 | From 1 May |
| Additional piling rig (3 rigs vs 2) | 2 | From 15 May |
| Parallel design review/construction | 2 | Ongoing |
| Weekend working (selective) | 1 | As required |
| **Total Recovery** | **8** | |

**Baseline Programme Rev 1:**

Submitted 15 April incorporating BEU comments. Recommended for formal approval.

I. Petrović acknowledged the recovery measures but noted that some are at SPCC's cost (acceleration to recover Contractor-caused delays). She proposed that the recovery programme be monitored monthly and that any costs claimed for recovery must distinguish between Employer and Contractor-caused delays.

T. Králík agreed to monthly monitoring but reserved SPCC's position on costs pending resolution of the entitlement claims.

**Decision:** Baseline Programme Rev 1 approved subject to incorporation of recovery measures.

**Action:** PMM-004/03 - M. Dvořák to submit Programme Rev 2 incorporating recovery measures | Due: 10 May 2019

### 7. Commercial Matters

J. Procházka presented commercial status:

**Claims Register:**

| Claim | Event | Status | EOT Claimed | Cost Claimed |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| DE-001 | Site access delay | Under discussion | 45 days | TBD |
| DE-002 | Ground conditions | Notified; being quantified | TBD | TBD |

**Variation Requests:**

| VO No. | Description | Value (EUR) | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| VO-001 | Additional ground investigation | 196,000 | Submitted; under review |
| VO-002 | Contaminated soil disposal | TBD | To be submitted |

**DE-001 Discussion:**

A. Nikolić confirmed BEU's rejection of the 45-day EOT claim (letter 18 April). SPCC has requested reconsideration (email 19 April).

J. Procházka maintained that the claim is valid and requested a meeting to discuss the Time Impact Analysis in detail.

A. Nikolić proposed that the matter be referred to the Engineer for determination if parties cannot agree within 14 days.

Dr. H. Weber confirmed the Engineer would make a determination if required under Sub-Clause 3.5.

**Action:** PMM-004/04 - Parties to meet on DE-001 claim by 10 May | Due: 10 May 2019

**VO-001 Evaluation:**

K. Hoffmann advised that the Engineer is reviewing VO-001 (additional ground investigation). Preliminary view is that the work was necessary but quantum requires verification. Target completion of evaluation: 15 May.
