**Subject:** Site Inspection - Formwork Quality Observations
---

Dear Pavel,

Following my site inspection this morning, I wish to bring the following observations to your attention regarding formwork quality. While these do not currently constitute non-conformances, they require attention to prevent quality issues.

**Inspection Details**
- Date: 6 August 2019
- Areas inspected: GT1 Pile Cap (Pour 2 preparation), HRSG Pour 9 preparation, Cooling Tower Pour 7 preparation
- Weather: Hot and dry, 34°C

**Observations**

**1. GT1 Pile Cap – Pour 2 Area**

| Item | Observation | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1.1 | Formwork joints at north edge showing gaps of 3-5mm | Seal with foam strip before pour |
| 1.2 | Two form ties appear loose at Grid G3 | Tighten and verify alignment |
| 1.3 | Release agent application appears uneven on east face | Re-apply before pour |
| 1.4 | Minor debris (rebar offcuts, wire) in bottom of form | Clean out before rebar inspection |

**Assessment:** These items are minor and readily rectifiable. Please address before the pre-pour inspection scheduled for tomorrow (7 August) at 07:00.

**2. HRSG Area – Pour 9 Preparation**

| Item | Observation | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 2.1 | Formwork in storage area (near Pour 10) showing weathering and minor damage | Inspect all panels before use; reject damaged panels |
| 2.2 | Kicker formwork at Grid H7 not aligned with survey marks | Re-align and verify level |
| 2.3 | Temporary bracing appears undersized for the formwork height (3.2m) | Verify bracing design; add intermediate props if required |

**Assessment:** Item 2.3 is of particular concern. The formwork bracing should be reviewed by your temporary works engineer before the pour proceeds. High ambient temperatures can affect formwork stability during long pours.

**3. Cooling Tower – Pour 7 Preparation**

| Item | Observation | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 3.1 | Satisfactory – no concerns noted | Continue as planned |

**General Observations**

I note that the increased pace of work (recovery programme) appears to be placing pressure on the formwork crews. The following general points are offered for consideration:

1. **Formwork reuse cycles:** Ensure adequate time is allowed between pour completion and form stripping to achieve required concrete strength. Minimum 24 hours at current temperatures.

2. **Release agent application:** Several areas showed inconsistent application. Consider designating a specific team member for this task to ensure consistency.

3. **Cleanliness:** General housekeeping in the formwork storage area could be improved. Clean formwork is essential for fair-faced concrete finishes.

4. **Documentation:** Please ensure formwork inspection checklists are completed and available for each pour. I was unable to locate the checklist for Pour 6 during today's inspection.

**Actions Requested**

1. Address GT1 items (1.1-1.4) before tomorrow's inspection
2. Review HRSG formwork bracing (item 2.3) – provide written confirmation from temporary works engineer
3. Inspect stored formwork panels and reject damaged items
4. Improve housekeeping in formwork storage area
5. Ensure inspection checklists are maintained and accessible

Please provide written confirmation by 12:00 tomorrow (7 August) that items 1 and 2 have been addressed. I will re-inspect before issuing pour clearance.

I appreciate the pressure the team is under with the recovery programme, and I want to be supportive. However, quality cannot be compromised. Taking time now to get the formwork right will avoid delays from defects later.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you wish to discuss any of the above.

Best regards,
