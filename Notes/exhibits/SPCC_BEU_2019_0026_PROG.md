**Subject: Revised Recovery Programme Rev 1**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; BEU/SPCC/2019/0019-PROG dated 12 August 2019**

Dear Mrs. Petrović,

In response to your comments of 12 August 2019, we hereby submit the Revised Recovery Programme Rev 1.

**1. Introduction**

1.1 This submission addresses the comments raised in your letter BEU/SPCC/2019/0019-PROG and incorporates updated progress data as at 16 August 2019.

1.2 We note that progress since the original Recovery Programme submission has been affected by:
- GT1 Pour 3 formwork complexity (1 day impact)
- BCC resource shortfall (being addressed)
- HRSG additional piling (on track)

**2. Response to Comments**

**2.1 GT1 Area Comments**

| Ref | Comment | Response |
|-----|---------|----------|
| 2.1.1 | Night shift piling recovery days | The 3-day recovery was achieved through combination of night shift (2 days) and productivity improvement from the second piling rig (1 day). Schedule logic has been clarified in Rev 1. |
| 2.1.2 | Three-pour pile cap structural confirmation | Structural engineer confirmation attached (Enclosure 1). The additional construction joints are acceptable with specified preparation requirements. |
| 2.1.3 | High-early-strength concrete Engineer acceptance | DPI confirmed acceptability on 8 August 2019 (email from M. Santos attached as Enclosure 2). |

**2.2 HRSG Area Comments**

| Ref | Comment | Response |
|-----|---------|----------|
| 2.2.1 | VO-004 not approved | Noted. Works proceeding under provisional instruction dated 9 August 2019. |
| 2.2.2 | Pours 11-12 technical dependencies | No technical dependencies exist between Pours 8-10 and Pours 11-12. They are in separate structural zones. Structural engineer confirmation attached (Enclosure 3). |
| 2.2.3 | Weekend working cost breakdown | Breakdown provided in Enclosure 4. Costs include premium rates (50% uplift), supervision, and support services. |

**2.3 Resource Histogram Comments**

| Ref | Comment | Response |
|-----|---------|----------|
| 2.3.1 | BCC commitment confirmation | Letter from BCC dated 15 August 2019 confirming resource commitment attached (Enclosure 5). Target of 120 personnel by 19 August. |
| 2.3.2 | Additional supervision names/qualifications | Details provided in Enclosure 6. Four additional supervisors: J. Novák (civil, 15 years), P. Marek (concrete, 12 years), L. Horák (formwork, 10 years), R. Dvořák (rebar, 8 years). |

**2.4 Risk Assessment Comments**

| Ref | Comment | Response |
|-----|---------|----------|
| 2.4.1 | Further ground conditions risk | Added to risk register as Item R-08 with probability "Medium" and impact "High". Mitigation: probe drilling ahead of excavation in remaining HRSG areas. |
| 2.4.2 | Material supply risk rating | Upgraded to "Medium" probability as suggested. Additional mitigation: increased buffer stock and secondary supplier arrangement. |

**2.5 Programme Logic Comments**

| Ref | Comment | Response |
|-----|---------|----------|
| 2.5.1 | GT1 Foundation Slab relationship | Revised to show 24-hour lag for initial curing. High-early-strength concrete achieves 15 MPa within 24 hours, adequate for formwork removal. |
| 2.5.2 | Near-critical paths | Acknowledged. We have identified 4 near-critical paths and assigned dedicated resource allocation to each. Float monitoring will be reported weekly. |

**3. Updated Programme Status**

**3.1 Progress Since Rev 0 (5 August)**

| Activity | Rev 0 Status | Current Status (16 Aug) | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------|-------|
| GT1 Pile Cap Pour 2 | Scheduled 7 Aug | Complete 7 Aug | On track |
| GT1 Pile Cap Pour 3 | Scheduled 12 Aug | Scheduled 17 Aug | 5 days late |
| HRSG Additional Piling | Scheduled start 12 Aug | 2 of 6 piles complete | On track |
| CT Pour 8 | Scheduled 14 Aug | Complete 14 Aug | On track |

**3.2 Revised Milestone Forecast**

| Milestone | Rev 0 (5 Aug) | Rev 1 (19 Aug) | Change |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| GT1 Pile Cap Complete | 14 Aug | 21 Aug | +7 days |
| GT1 Foundation Slab | 28 Aug | 2 Sep | +5 days |
| HRSG Complete | 6 Sep | 8 Sep | +2 days |
| CT Complete | 30 Aug | 30 Aug | 0 |
| **Foundation Completion** | **6 Sep** | **8 Sep** | **+2 days** |

**3.3 Explanation of Slippage**

The 2-day slippage from Rev 0 is attributable to:

| Cause | Days | Category |
|-------|------|----------|
| GT1 Pour 3 formwork complexity | 3 | Contractor |
| BCC resource shortfall | 2 | Contractor |
| Recovery measures achieved | (3) | Mitigation |
| **Net slippage** | **2** | |

**4. Enhanced Recovery Measures**

To address the slippage and achieve the Foundation Completion milestone as close to 1 September as possible, we are implementing the following additional measures:

| Measure | Start | Days Recovery | Cost (EUR) |
|---------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Extended night shift (GT1) | 19 Aug | 2 | 35,000 |
| Sunday working | 25 Aug | 1 | 18,000 |
| Additional crane for rebar | 20 Aug | 1 | 12,000 |
| **Total Additional** | | **4** | **65,000** |

**4.1 Revised Milestone Forecast with Additional Measures**

| Milestone | Without Additional | With Additional |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| GT1 Foundation | 2 Sep | 30 Aug |
| Foundation Completion | 8 Sep | 5 Sep |

**Implementation of these measures would reduce the delay to 4 days** (versus the current 7-day forecast).

**5. BCC Resource Status**

5.1 We have formally notified BCC of the requirement to achieve committed resource levels (letter dated 15 August – Enclosure 7).

5.2 BCC has confirmed target of 120 personnel by Monday 19 August.

5.3 Daily headcount reporting to BEU has commenced as requested.

5.4 As at 16 August, BCC reported 108 personnel on site – an improvement from the 97 reported on 12 August.

**6. Reporting Arrangements**

As requested, we confirm the following enhanced reporting:

| Report | Frequency | Distribution |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| GT1/HRSG daily progress | Daily | BEU, DPI |
| Photographic record | Each pour | BEU, DPI |
| 2-week look-ahead | Weekly (Monday) | BEU, DPI |
| BCC headcount | Daily | BEU |

**7. Summary**

7.1 The Foundation Completion milestone is currently forecast for **5 September 2019** with implementation of additional recovery measures – representing a **4-day delay** to the contractual date.

7.2 Of this delay:
- 5 days attributable to HRSG unforeseen ground conditions (Employer risk under Sub-Clause 4.12)
- (1) day recovery achieved through Contractor acceleration

7.3 We remain committed to minimising the delay and will continue to implement all reasonable recovery measures.

We trust this revised submission addresses the Employer's comments and look forward to your acknowledgement.

Yours sincerely,

**Martin Dvořák**
