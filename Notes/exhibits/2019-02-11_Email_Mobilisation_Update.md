**From:** Miroslav Horák <m.horak@spcc-jv.com>  
**To:** Ivana Petrović <i.petrovic@beu.bd>  
**Cc:** Tomáš Králík <t.kralik@spcc-jv.com>; Dr. Miloš Vladić <m.vladic@beu.bd>  
**Date:** 11 February 2019, 11:40  
**Subject:** Mobilisation progress update

Dear Ivana,

I wanted to provide you with a brief update on our mobilisation progress as we approach the end of the second week on site. Overall, things are proceeding well and we remain on schedule.

**Completed Items:**

✓ Site offices fully operational (8 workstations, meeting rooms, communications)  
✓ Temporary power and water connections completed  
✓ Site access control established (gate, fencing, signage)  
✓ Safety induction programme operational  
✓ Survey control network established  
✓ First weekly progress meeting held (6 Feb) with good attendance  
✓ Waste management and segregation areas set up  
✓ Initial site clearing completed (debris removal)

**This Week's Activities:**

- Welfare facilities arrived this morning (11 Feb) - installation underway, should be operational by end of week
- Preparing materials storage compound (fencing, security, weather protection)
- Topographic survey in progress (completion expected 15 Feb)
- Site roads grading and improvement (making access more suitable for heavy deliveries)
- Additional temporary lighting installation

**Personnel on Site:**

Currently 12 SPCC personnel on site, increasing to 18 by end of week. Composition:
- Project management: 2
- Engineering: 3
- Construction supervision: 4
- HSE: 2
- Administration/document control: 1
- Survey team: 3 (temporary, will demobilise after survey complete)
- Workshop/maintenance: 2

We're still operating in "mobilisation mode" - no major construction activities yet. The team is focused on establishment and preparation for the ground investigation and subsequent civil works.

**Upcoming Key Activities (Rest of February):**

1. **Ground Investigation:** Drilling contractor (Balkan Geotechnical) ready to mobilise 18 Feb, pending your approval of the investigation programme. Any update on this?

2. **Design Batch 2 Submission:** Civil and structural design package will be submitted to DPI by 15 February (slight delay from original 8 Feb target due to some detailing requirements).

3. **Civil Works Subcontractor Tender:** We're preparing tender documents for the civil works package (earthworks, piling, foundations, structures). Plan to issue tenders 20 February with bid return by 20 March, allowing contract award in early April for May mobilisation.

4. **Quality Plan Submission:** On track for submission by 15 February as committed.

**Issues / Concerns:**

1. **NE Site Area Access:** This remains unresolved. We need access for ground investigation (estimated 5 days of drilling in that area). Branko mentioned at last week's meeting that he would update us by 12 February (tomorrow). Can you provide any update on progress?

2. **Weather:** We've had some cold and wet weather last week which slowed outdoor work slightly, but nothing serious. Forecast for this week looks better (temperatures above freezing, less rain).

3. **Welfare Facilities Delay:** Minor issue - the welfare facilities were delayed by 2 days due to a transport problem, but this hasn't impacted anything critical. They arrived today and should be fully operational by Friday.

**Financial:**

Our first monthly payment application for January will be submitted this week (by 14 Feb). Value will be modest - essentially mobilisation costs and preliminary works. I estimate around EUR 850,000, subject to final reconciliation with our commercial team.

**Looking Ahead to March:**

Assuming ground investigation proceeds as planned (18 Feb start), we should have preliminary results by mid-March and final report by early April. This keeps us on track for foundation design approval and civil works start in May.

The next critical milestone is Basic Design approval (all batches) by mid-April. We're working hard to maintain this schedule, and the design team is fully engaged.

**Site Visit:**

I understand Dr. Vladić and senior BEU management are planning a site visit in late February. We would be happy to host this. A tour of the site and briefing on mobilisation would take about 2 hours. Could you let me know the proposed date so we can prepare?

**Weekly Reporting:**

Going forward, you'll receive:
- Weekly Progress Meeting minutes (every Wednesday, issued within 3 days)
- Monthly Progress Reports (submitted by 7th of following month, covering technical progress, programme, cost, HSE, quality, commercial matters)
- Ad-hoc correspondence as needed for specific issues

Is there any other reporting you would like to see? We want to ensure BEU has good visibility of progress without creating unnecessary administrative burden.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have any concerns about our mobilisation progress.

Best regards,
