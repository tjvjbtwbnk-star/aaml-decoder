**Subject: Project Status at End of Q3 2019 – Employer's Concerns**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001**

Dear Mr. Králík,

As we conclude Q3 2019, I am writing to express the Employer's concerns regarding the current status of the Project and to ensure alignment on expectations for the coming quarter.

**1. Overview**

The Borduria Combined Cycle Power Plant is a nationally significant infrastructure project. The Employer selected the Syldavian Power Construction Consortium based on your technical capability and track record. While we acknowledge the progress made, Q3 2019 has raised concerns that we wish to address directly.

**2. Q3 Performance Summary**

| Metric | Target | Actual | Assessment |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Overall Progress | 23% | 22.5% | Below target |
| Foundation Completion | 1 Sep | 7 Sep | 6 days late |
| Design Progress | 55% | 55% | On target |
| Safety (LTIs) | 0 | 0 | On target |
| Safety (MTCs) | 0 | 1 | Below target |
| NCRs | 0 | 1 | Below target |

**3. Specific Concerns**

**3.1 Foundation Completion Delay**

The Foundation Completion milestone was achieved 6 days late. While we acknowledge that 5 days are attributable to unforeseen ground conditions (VO-004), the Engineer has determined that 1 day is Contractor-caused delay. We note that SPCC has issued a notice of dissatisfaction, but the Employer maintains its position that delay damages are applicable.

**3.2 Safety Incident**

The lifting incident on 18 September resulted in two workers being injured. While the injuries were minor, the incident was preventable. The root cause analysis identified failures in lift planning compliance, supervision, and exclusion zone enforcement – all basic safety requirements.

We are particularly concerned that this incident occurred within weeks of significant discussions about subcontractor (BCC) performance issues.

**3.3 GT1 Foundation Quality Issue**

The discovery of a failed cube test result for the GT1 foundation slab is deeply concerning. The GT1 foundation is the most critical structural element on the project. While we await core test results, the implications of this issue are significant:

- GT1 installation may be delayed
- Remediation costs may be substantial
- Questions arise about quality control during the accelerated foundation programme

The Employer expects a comprehensive report by 10 October as committed.

**3.4 Design Programme**

Detailed design was scheduled for completion by 30 September 2019. The current forecast is 18 October – an 18-day delay. While we understand the impacts of VO-003 and grid data issues, the cumulative effect of design delays may affect procurement and construction.

**3.5 Claims Accumulation**

The number of disputed claims is concerning:

| Claim | Status | Disputed Amount |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| DE-002 | Under reconsideration | ~EUR 800K + 33 days |
| DE-004 | Submitted | EUR 127.5K + 18 days |
| Foundation Damages | Dissatisfied | EUR 25K |

We note the senior commercial meeting scheduled for 7 October and hope this will lead to constructive resolution.

**4. Employer's Expectations for Q4**

**4.1 GT1 Foundation Resolution**

The GT1 foundation issue must be resolved promptly:
- Investigation report by 10 October
- Remediation plan (if required) by 15 October
- Remediation complete before GT1 installation
- No impact on GT1 delivery acceptance

**4.2 Safety Performance**

The Q3 incident must be an isolated occurrence:
- Zero further recordable incidents
- Continued implementation of enhanced lifting controls
- Monthly safety reviews with BEU participation

**4.3 Design Completion**

Detailed design must be completed by 25 October at the latest:
- Priority on critical path items
- Cooling system design coordination with CoolTech
- No further slippage

**4.4 Construction Progress**

Q4 construction targets:
- Admin Building steel complete by 15 October
- HRSG steel 50% by end November
- GT pedestal construction complete by end November
- Building envelope commencement

**4.5 Commercial Resolution**

The Employer is willing to discuss commercial settlement but expects:
- Realistic positions from the Contractor
- Recognition of Contractor responsibilities where appropriate
- Focus on project delivery, not adversarial claims management

**5. Senior Oversight**

Given the issues arising in Q3, I will be increasing my personal involvement in the Project:

- Monthly site visits (next visit: 15 October)
- Direct updates from the SPCC Project Manager
- Attendance at PMM-010 in October

I also request that you, as Project Director, increase your own engagement with the site team.

**6. Conclusion**

The Employer remains committed to the successful delivery of this Project. However, the issues arising in Q3 have eroded confidence. Q4 must demonstrate:

- Resolution of the GT1 foundation issue
- Zero safety incidents
- Design completion
- Meaningful progress on commercial settlement
- Overall progress back on target

I look forward to discussing these matters at the senior commercial meeting on 7 October and at our subsequent interactions.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Miloš Vladić**
Project Director
Borduria Energy Utilities S.A.
