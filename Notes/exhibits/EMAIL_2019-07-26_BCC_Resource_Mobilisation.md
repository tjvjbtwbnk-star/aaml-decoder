**Subject:** BCC Resource Mobilisation Update
---

Dear Pavel,

Further to our discussion at the PMM yesterday and the Employer's request for a Recovery Programme, I am writing to confirm BCC's resource mobilisation commitments.

**Current Position**

As of today, BCC has the following personnel on site:

| Trade | Current | Location |
|-------|---------|----------|
| General labourers | 32 | All areas |
| Carpenters (formwork) | 18 | HRSG, CT areas |
| Steel fixers | 22 | GT1, HRSG areas |
| Concrete finishers | 8 | All areas |
| Plant operators | 5 | All areas |
| Supervisors | 4 | All areas |
| **Total** | **89** | |

**Committed Additional Resources**

In response to the programme recovery requirements, BCC commits to mobilising the following additional personnel:

| Trade | Additional | Start Date | Assignment |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| Steel fixers | +6 | 29 July | GT1 pile cap |
| Carpenters | +4 | 29 July | HRSG formwork |
| Concrete finishers | +2 | 29 July | All areas |
| General labourers | +4 | 29 July | Support |
| Night shift team | +12 | 29 July | GT1 (rotating) |
| **Total Additional** | **+28** | | |

**Revised Total:** 117 personnel (32% increase)

**Equipment**

We are also mobilising the following additional equipment:

| Item | Quantity | Arrival |
|------|----------|---------|
| Concrete pump (mobile) | 1 | On site 27 July |
| Tower crane operator (night) | 1 | 29 July |
| Lighting towers | 4 | On site 26 July |
| Generator (backup for night works) | 1 | On site 27 July |

**Night Shift Arrangements**

For the GT1 night shift operations:
- Working hours: 20:00 - 06:00
- Supervisor: Dragan Mitić (experienced night shift foreman)
- First aid attendant: Confirmed
- Security: Coordinated with SPCC site security
- Hot meal provision: Arranged with canteen contractor

**Productivity Commitment**

With the additional resources, BCC commits to the following productivity targets:

| Activity | Current Rate | Target Rate |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Formwork installation | 45 m²/day | 65 m²/day |
| Rebar fixing | 8 tonnes/day | 12 tonnes/day |
| Concrete pour support | 200 m³/day | 280 m³/day |

**Constraints**

I must advise of the following constraints:

1. **Accommodation:** The additional night shift workers require accommodation. We have secured rooms at the Klow-East workers' hostel but at premium rates. Please confirm SPCC will cover this additional cost (estimated EUR 1,200/week).

2. **Transport:** Additional minibus required for night shift transport. Cost approximately EUR 400/week.

3. **PPE:** Additional PPE required for new workers. We will procure and back-charge per our subcontract terms.

4. **Supervision:** Goran will work extended hours (06:00-20:00) during the critical GT1 period. Please ensure SPCC site supervision is available to support the night team.

**Quality Commitment**

Despite the increased pace, BCC remains committed to quality. We understand the importance of getting this right first time, particularly for the GT1 foundation. Goran will personally inspect all GT1 rebar installation before pour clearance is requested.

Please confirm acceptance of this mobilisation plan and the accommodation/transport cost recovery at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
