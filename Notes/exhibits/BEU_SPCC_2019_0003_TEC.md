# LETTER

**BORDURIA ENERGY UTILITIES S.A.**  
42 Boulevard Marshal Douma  
Szohôd, Borduria

**Reference:** BEU/SPCC/2019/0003-TEC  
**Date:** 8 February 2019

Dr. Wilhelm Braun  
Engineering Manager  
Syldavian Power Construction Consortium  
15 Ottokar IV Boulevard  
Klow, Syldavia

Dear Dr. Braun,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – RESPONSE TO DESIGN BASIS QUERIES

We acknowledge receipt of the email from Dr. Yuki Tanaka dated 7 February 2019 raising various design basis clarification queries. We appreciate SPCC's diligence in identifying these matters early in the design process.

Having reviewed the queries with our technical team, I provide the following responses:

---

**1. FUEL GAS COMPOSITION - SEASONAL VARIATION**

**Response:** Based on data from Bordurian National Gas Company (BNGC), the fuel gas composition is relatively stable throughout the year. The parameters you should use for design are:

- **Higher Heating Value (HHV):** 39.5 ± 0.8 MJ/Nm³ (your assumption of ±1.0 is acceptable and conservative)
- **Seasonal variation:** Minimal. Gas supply is predominantly from domestic fields with stable composition
- **Wobbe Index range:** 48.5 - 50.5 MJ/Nm³
- **LNG introduction:** BNGC has no current plans to introduce LNG or alternative gases within the next 10 years. If this changes, appropriate notice will be given, and any necessary plant modifications would be addressed through the variation procedure.

We will provide you with 5 years of historical gas analysis data from the grid connection point to support your detailed design.

**Action Required:** BEU to provide historical gas analysis data (Dragan Kostić - by 15 February).

---

**2. AMBIENT TEMPERATURE - PERFORMANCE TEST CONDITIONS**

**Response:** Performance tests shall be conducted in accordance with ISO 2314 (or the latest applicable ISO standard at the time of testing). 

- **Test timing:** Tests should be scheduled during spring or autumn when ambient temperatures are typically 10-20°C, as this provides more representative conditions for guarantee verification
- **Corrections:** Standard corrections per ISO 2314 shall be applied to normalize test results to ISO base conditions
- **Tolerance:** Ambient conditions during testing should be stable (±2°C over the test duration) and representative. If conditions are extreme or rapidly changing, tests may be rescheduled

The guaranteed performance values should be presented at both:
- ISO base conditions (15°C, 1013 mbar, 60% RH)
- Site reference conditions (20°C, 996 mbar, 60% RH) - this is our preferred reference point

**Action Required:** SPCC to confirm guaranteed performance values at both ISO and site reference conditions in design documentation.

**3. COOLING WATER - RIVER VLAJA SUPPLY**

**Response:** The following information clarifies the cooling water supply arrangements:

- **Abstraction limits:** Environmental permit allows abstraction of up to 200 m³/hr continuously. The 150 m³/hr you have assumed is correct for design purposes. No seasonal restrictions apply.
- **Minimum river flow:** Historical minimum flow is 15 m³/s, so the 200 m³/hr (0.056 m³/s) abstraction is negligible and confirmed as acceptable.
- **Water treatment:** Preliminary treatment (screening and sedimentation) will be required. This is within SPCC's scope and should be included in your cooling water system design.
- **Abstraction infrastructure:** BEU will provide the intake structure and pumping station to deliver raw water to the plant boundary. Connection point will be at the southwestern corner of the site at coordinates N 464,920m / E 623,150m. Design flow: 200 m³/hr at 3 bar pressure.

A separate interface agreement covering the cooling water supply will be issued to SPCC by end of February.

**Action Required:** BEU to issue cooling water supply interface agreement (Dragan Kostić - by 28 February).

**4. GRID CONNECTION - VOLTAGE AND FREQUENCY STABILITY**

**Response:** The following grid parameters are provided by Bordurian Transmission System Operator (BTSO):

- **Short-circuit level at POC:** 40 kA (3-phase fault level)
- **Voltage variation:** ±5% (380-420 kV) under normal operation
- **Frequency stability:** 50 Hz ±0.2 Hz (normal operation), 50 Hz ±1.0 Hz (exceptional disturbances)
- **Grid code compliance:** Bordurian Grid Code (2018) applies. Key requirements include:
  - Reactive power capability: Power factor range 0.95 leading to 0.95 lagging at all loads above 50%
  - Voltage ride-through per Figure 3.2 of Grid Code
  - Frequency ride-through: Continuous operation from 47.5 to 51.5 Hz
  - Ramp rate control: 10% per minute maximum rate of change

A full copy of the Bordurian Grid Code will be provided to SPCC. BTSO requires submission of electrical system design for review and approval before construction of grid connection facilities.

**Action Required:** BEU to provide copy of Bordurian Grid Code (Stefan Jovanović - by 12 February).

**5. STARTING POWER SUPPLY**

**Response:** BEU will provide temporary starting power for commissioning activities from an existing 11 kV line that passes near the southern site boundary. 

- **Available capacity:** 3 MVA (adequate for your estimated requirement)
- **Voltage:** 11 kV
- **Connection point:** To be determined (surveying required)
- **Availability:** From January 2022 onwards
- **Metering and charges:** Consumption will be metered; SPCC responsible for electricity costs during commissioning

SPCC shall design and install the temporary connection including transformer, switchgear, and distribution to commissioning loads. This connection shall be removed after plant commissioning is complete and the plant achieves self-sustaining operation.

**Action Required:** BEU to confirm exact connection point location (Stefan Jovanović - by 15 March).

**6. NATURAL GAS PIPELINE - PRESSURE AND AVAILABILITY**

**Response:** The gas pipeline is being constructed by Bordurian National Gas Company (BNGC) under a separate contract with the Ministry of Energy. Based on current information:

- **Delivery pressure at plant boundary:** 42 barg (your assumption of 40 barg is acceptable for design)
- **Commissioning gas availability:** BNGC has committed to progressive commissioning. Individual sections will be available for pressure testing and commissioning from April 2022. Gas supply for your GT commissioning (September 2022) is confirmed.
- **Gas quality for commissioning:** Same specification as operational gas. BNGC will provide gas quality certification before commissioning commences.
- **Fiscal metering:** BNGC responsibility at the point of delivery (plant boundary). SPCC should allow for metering skid installation point in your design.

BEU is managing the interface with BNGC. Any issues affecting the gas supply schedule will be communicated to SPCC promptly.

**Action Required:** BEU to provide formal interface agreement with BNGC schedule (Ivana Petrović - by 31 March).

**7. BLACK START CAPABILITY**

**Response:** After discussion with our operations team, we can clarify that the black start requirement is as follows:

- **Black start from grid:** The plant must be capable of starting from the 400 kV grid connection (grid-assisted start). This is the standard mode.
- **Island operation:** Once running, the plant must be capable of islanded operation (disconnected from grid) at loads from 40% to 100%.
- **No autonomous black start:** True black start capability (starting with no external power) is NOT required. The existing grid network in Borduria has adequate reliability.

Therefore, no special diesel generators or battery systems for black start are required beyond the normal station auxiliary power systems.

**SPCC action:** Design should include standard station auxiliary power with adequate battery backup for control systems and emergency lighting. Typical combined cycle plant configuration is acceptable.

**TECHNICAL COORDINATION MEETING**

We agree that a technical coordination meeting would be beneficial to ensure mutual understanding on these and any other technical interface matters. We propose:

- **Date:** Wednesday, 13 February 2019, 14:00 (after the weekly progress meeting)
- **Venue:** SPCC site office or BEU office Szohôd (SPCC to advise preference)
- **Duration:** 3 hours
- **Attendees:** Dr. Tanaka, Dr. Braun, Dragan Kostić, Stefan Jovanović, and Engineer's representative

Please confirm if this timing is suitable.

**CLOSING**

We trust these responses address the queries raised and provide a sound basis for your detailed design to proceed. Should any further clarifications be required, please do not hesitate to raise them.

BEU appreciates SPCC's proactive approach in resolving design basis issues early. This is essential for avoiding later complications and maintaining the project schedule.

Yours sincerely,
