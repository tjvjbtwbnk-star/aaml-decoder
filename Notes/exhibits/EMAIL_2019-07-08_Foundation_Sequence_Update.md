---

Dear Branko,

Good morning. As discussed at last week's WPM, please find below the updated foundation construction sequence for the week commencing 8 July 2019.

**GT1 Bored Piling**

| Activity | Planned | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Piles complete to date | 6 | GP-01 to GP-06 |
| Piles planned this week | 7-8 | GP-07 to GP-14 |
| Forecast total by 12 July | 13-14 | Subject to weather |

Productivity has improved to 1.2 piles/day. We are targeting 1.5/day from mid-week once the second shift becomes fully effective. Concrete cube tests continue to show compliant results (42-46 MPa achieved vs 40 MPa specified).

**Admin Building Foundation**

| Pour | Status | Date | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Pour 5 | Scheduled | 8 July | Inspection 07:00, pour to commence 09:00 |
| Pour 6 | Preparation | 15 July | Final pour - foundation complete |

Pour 5 today is the penultimate pour for the Admin Building. Maria Santos (DPI) confirmed attendance for the pre-pour inspection. BCC have 12 workers assigned. Estimated concrete volume: 185 m³. Pour duration: approximately 6 hours.

**HRSG Area Foundations**

| Pour | Status | Date | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Pour 4 | Rebar installation | 10 July | Formwork complete |
| Pour 5 | Formwork | 12 July | |
| Pour 6 | Excavation/prep | 15 July | |

We have increased BCC resources in the HRSG area to maintain programme. Current workforce: 35 personnel. Rebar delivery from Balkan Steel is tracking to schedule – next delivery due tomorrow (9 July).

**Cooling Tower Area**

| Pour | Status | Date | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Pour 2 | Formwork | 11 July | |
| Pour 3 | Excavation | 15 July | |

Note: Cooling tower foundation design is preliminary pending DE-003 resolution. Current works are for the common raft section which is unaffected by the cooling tower type selection.

**Weather Considerations**

The forecast for this week shows continued high temperatures (33-36°C). We are implementing the following measures:

- Night pours considered for Pour 5 today if temperature exceeds 35°C at 09:00
- Ice added to concrete mix to control placement temperature
- Misting systems operational on all curing concrete
- Curing compound application within 30 minutes of finishing
- Additional curing period monitoring (7-day and 14-day cube tests)

**Resource Summary**

| Area | BCC Workers | SPCC Supervision |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| GT1 Piling | 22 | 4 |
| Admin Foundation | 12 | 2 |
| HRSG Foundations | 35 | 4 |
| Cooling Tower | 16 | 2 |
| **Total** | **85** | **12** |

Please let me know if you require any additional information or would like to discuss any aspect of the sequence. I will be on site all week and available to walk through any areas of interest.

Best regards,
