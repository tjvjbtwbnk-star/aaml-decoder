**Subject: Response to VO-003 Clarification Queries**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Your email dated 2 July 2019; Our ref. SPCC/BEU/2019/0019-COM**

Dear Mrs. Nikolić,

We refer to your email of 2 July 2019 requesting clarification on various aspects of our claim submission in respect of DE-003 (Cooling System Modification). We appreciate the prompt attention being given to this matter and provide our responses below.

**1. Cost Breakdown**

**1(a) Hybrid Cooling Tower Supply – EUR 8,450,000**

This figure is based on a budgetary quotation received from CoolTech GmbH dated 18 June 2019 (reference CT/BCCPP/Q-003). A copy of this quotation is enclosed (Enclosure 1). We would note that:

- CoolTech has indicated this quotation is valid for 60 days
- The quotation assumes order placement by 1 September 2019 to maintain the delivery programme
- Final pricing will be subject to detailed design confirmation

**1(b) Design Development – EUR 2,180,000**

This cost has been calculated based on the following resource requirements:

| Resource | Duration | Rate (EUR/day) | Total (EUR) |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Lead Mechanical Engineer | 12 weeks | 1,850 | 111,000 |
| Process Engineer | 12 weeks | 1,650 | 99,000 |
| Civil Engineer (foundations) | 8 weeks | 1,450 | 58,000 |
| Electrical Engineer | 6 weeks | 1,550 | 46,500 |
| I&C Engineer | 6 weeks | 1,550 | 46,500 |
| Design Coordinator | 12 weeks | 1,250 | 75,000 |
| CAD Resources (3 No.) | 12 weeks | 950 | 171,000 |
| Document Control | 12 weeks | 750 | 45,000 |
| **Subtotal – Direct Resources** | | | **652,000** |
| CoolTech Design Support | Lump Sum | | 480,000 |
| Third-party reviews | Lump Sum | | 185,000 |
| Equipment/software | Lump Sum | | 78,000 |
| **Subtotal – External** | | | **743,000** |
| Overhead & Profit (15%) | | | 209,250 |
| Contingency (10%) | | | 160,425 |
| **Sub-total – Design Contingency** | | | **369,675** |
| **Rounded Total** | | | **2,180,000** |

A detailed resource schedule is enclosed (Enclosure 2).

**1(c) Civil Works Modifications – EUR 4,250,000**

This figure includes a contingency of 12% to account for the preliminary nature of the design at this stage. The breakdown is:

| Item | Base Cost (EUR) | Contingency (12%) | Total (EUR) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Foundation modifications | 1,420,000 | 170,400 | 1,590,400 |
| Structural steel changes | 680,000 | 81,600 | 761,600 |
| Piping rerouting | 890,000 | 106,800 | 996,800 |
| Electrical/cable changes | 420,000 | 50,400 | 470,400 |
| Additional earthworks | 385,000 | 46,200 | 431,200 |
| **Total** | **3,795,000** | **455,400** | **4,250,400** |

We submit that this level of contingency is reasonable given the early stage of design development.

**2. Programme Impact**

**2(a) Delay Analysis**

A detailed delay analysis is enclosed (Enclosure 3) demonstrating the critical path impact. In summary:

- The cooling system design is on the critical path for detailed design completion
- Hybrid cooling tower procurement lead time is 14 weeks longer than the original wet cooling specification
- Foundation modifications must be complete before cooling tower erection can commence
- The 85-day extension accounts for the net critical path impact after allowing for parallel activities

**2(b) Design Duration – Sequential vs Parallel**

The 12-week design duration assumes maximum practical parallelisation:

- Weeks 1-4: Process design and CoolTech technical coordination (sequential – must establish parameters)
- Weeks 5-12: Detailed mechanical, civil, electrical, I&C design (parallel activities)

Without the initial sequential phase, the remaining disciplines cannot proceed as they depend on confirmed cooling system parameters.

**2(c) Mitigation Measures**

The following mitigation measures have been incorporated in arriving at the 85-day figure:

- Parallel working of design disciplines (as above)
- Engagement of additional design resources
- Expedited procurement with CoolTech (air freight of critical components)
- Acceleration of foundation works where achievable

Without these measures, our analysis indicates the impact would be approximately 110 days.

**3. Contractual Basis**

**3(a) Sub-Clause 13.2 (Value Engineering)**

Our claim is made under Sub-Clause 13.3 (Variation Procedure) in response to the Employer's instruction of 5 June 2019. We are not claiming under Sub-Clause 13.2.

We acknowledge that the hybrid cooling system may offer certain operational benefits (reduced water consumption, reduced visual impact). However, these benefits were not the reason for the change – the change was mandated by the new environmental regulations (Ministry of Environment Regulation No. 2019/127). The Contractor did not propose this change.

Should the Employer wish to discuss any value engineering credits, we are willing to engage in such discussions separately from the determination of our entitlement.

**3(b) Date of Instruction**

The Contractor considers the instruction to have been given on 5 June 2019, being the date of your letter BEU/SPCC/2019/0013-TEC titled "Instruction – Cooling System Modification" which stated:

*"The Contractor is hereby instructed to modify the cooling system design to incorporate a hybrid wet/dry cooling tower in compliance with the requirements of Ministry of Environment Regulation No. 2019/127."*

This constitutes an instruction under Sub-Clause 3.3 and a Variation under Sub-Clause 13.1.

**4. Technical Queries**

**4(a) Water Consumption Reduction**

The reduction from 2,400 m³/hr to 1,400 m³/hr is based on CoolTech's technical proposal for the hybrid system. This figure is stated in their quotation as a "guaranteed maximum consumption at design ambient conditions." Supporting technical data from CoolTech is included in Enclosure 1.

**4(b) Foundation Requirements**

Preliminary foundation assessment has been undertaken. Key findings:

- Cooling tower footprint increases from 2,800 m² to 3,400 m² due to larger structure
- Foundation loads increase by approximately 35% due to hybrid system weight
- Preliminary pile design indicates 8 additional piles required (12 No. total vs 4 No. original)
- Detailed foundation design will be included in the design package

A preliminary foundation layout is enclosed (Enclosure 4).

We trust this response addresses your queries. Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us. We remain available to meet to discuss this matter at your convenience.

Given the programme implications, we would respectfully request that the Employer provides a preliminary position on VO-003 by 19 July 2019 to enable timely order placement with CoolTech.

Yours sincerely,
