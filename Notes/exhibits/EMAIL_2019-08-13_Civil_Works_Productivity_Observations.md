**Subject:** Civil Works Productivity Observations - Weekly Summary
---

Dear Ivana,

As requested, I am providing my weekly observations on civil works productivity. This week has seen increased activity due to the recovery programme, but I have some concerns to bring to your attention.

**1. GT1 Pile Cap Works**

| Metric | Planned | Actual | Variance |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Pour 2 completion | 7 Aug | 7 Aug | On time |
| Pour 3 formwork | 5 days | 6 days | +1 day |
| Rebar installation rate | 12 t/day | 9 t/day | -25% |

**Observations:**
- Pour 2 was completed successfully, but I noted the pour took 9 hours rather than the planned 6 hours due to a concrete pump breakdown mid-pour. Backup pump was mobilised but there was a 90-minute delay.
- Pour 3 formwork is progressing slower than planned. The BCC crew appears to be fatigued – they have been working extended hours for two weeks.
- Rebar installation rate is below target. The steel fixers are competent but there appear to be coordination issues with the crane for rebar bundle lifting.

**2. HRSG Area**

The situation is complicated by the ground conditions issue. Observations on the unaffected areas:

| Activity | Planned | Actual | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| Pour 11 preparation | On track | On track | Good progress |
| Pour 12 excavation | On track | 1 day behind | Equipment redeployment delay |

**Observations:**
- The decision to proceed with Pours 11-12 in parallel while Pours 8-10 are on hold is sensible from a programme perspective.
- However, I note that this creates complexity for the BCC supervision – they are now managing non-contiguous work areas.
- The additional piling equipment arrived yesterday (12 August) and is being set up. First pile drilling expected tomorrow.

**3. Cooling Tower**

| Pour | Planned | Actual | Status |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Pour 7 | 9 Aug | 9 Aug | Complete |
| Pour 8 | 14 Aug | 14 Aug | On track |

**Observations:**
- Cooling Tower works are progressing well and appear to be on track.
- The quality of formwork is good and the BCC foreman (G. Stanković) is managing this area effectively.

**4. BCC Resource Observations**

I conducted a headcount on Monday morning:

| Trade | Claimed | Observed | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| General labourers | 45 | 38 | 7 absent |
| Carpenters | 22 | 20 | 2 absent |
| Steel fixers | 28 | 24 | 4 absent |
| Concrete finishers | 10 | 10 | Full complement |
| Supervisors | 6 | 5 | 1 on leave |
| **Total** | **111** | **97** | **-13%** |

This is concerning. The Recovery Programme assumes 125 BCC personnel on site. On Monday, there were only 97 – a shortfall of 28 workers (22%).

I raised this with Pavel Novotný who stated that some workers were on a rest day following weekend work. However, the weekend working was supposed to be with additional resources, not reduced weekday staffing.

**5. Quality Observations**

- Formwork quality has been generally satisfactory, though I noted some issues flagged by Maria Santos last week.
- Concrete cube test results continue to be compliant.
- Housekeeping in the GT1 area could be improved – there is accumulated debris that could present a safety hazard.

**6. Overall Assessment**

While the SPCC team is clearly making efforts to implement the recovery programme, I have concerns about sustainability:

1. **Fatigue:** The extended working hours are affecting productivity. Workers appear tired and less focused.

2. **Resource shortfall:** BCC is not consistently providing the committed workforce levels.

3. **Coordination:** The split between GT1, HRSG (multiple areas), and CT is stretching supervision.

4. **Quality risk:** The pressure to maintain pace may lead to quality shortcuts. I will increase my inspection frequency.

**7. Recommendation**

I recommend that we raise the BCC resource shortfall formally at the next WPM. If this continues, it may be grounds for SPCC to take action against BCC under their subcontract – and potentially an Employer concern under the main contract if it affects the milestone.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of the above.

Best regards,
