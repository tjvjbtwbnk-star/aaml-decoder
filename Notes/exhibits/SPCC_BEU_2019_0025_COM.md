**Subject: Request for Variation – Additional Piling (VO-004)**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clauses 4.12 and 13.3**

Dear Mrs. Nikolić,

**1. Introduction**

1.1 We write to formally request a Variation Order in respect of additional piling works required at the HRSG foundation area due to unforeseen ground conditions encountered on 2 August 2019.

1.2 This letter constitutes notice under Sub-Clause 4.12 (Unforeseeable Physical Conditions) and a request for a Variation under Sub-Clause 13.3 (Variation Procedure).

**2. Background**

2.1 On 2 August 2019, during excavation for HRSG Foundation Pour 8 (Grid Lines H4-H6), the Contractor encountered ground conditions materially different from those indicated in the Geotechnical Report (BGS Report GEO-2019-001).

2.2 The conditions encountered were:

| Parameter | Expected (per GEO report) | Actual |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------|
| Soil type at -3.0m | Medium dense sand | Soft organic clay |
| SPT N-value | 18-22 | 4-6 |
| Groundwater level | Below -5.0m | At -2.8m |
| Bearing capacity | 200 kPa | ~50 kPa |

2.3 These conditions were witnessed by the Engineer's Resident Engineer (Ms. Maria Santos) on 2 August 2019.

2.4 Additional ground investigation (3 boreholes) was conducted on 3-4 August 2019, confirming a localised zone of poor ground affecting approximately 400 m².

**3. Unforeseeability**

3.1 The Contractor submits that these conditions constitute Unforeseeable Physical Conditions under Sub-Clause 4.12.

3.2 The Contract defines Unforeseeable as "not reasonably foreseeable by an experienced contractor by the date for submission of the Tender."

3.3 The conditions were unforeseeable because:

(a) The Geotechnical Report (BGS GEO-2019-001) provided by the Employer indicated consistent medium dense sand conditions across the HRSG area;

(b) The nearest borehole to the affected area (BH-12) showed no indication of soft organic soils or high groundwater;

(c) The localised nature of the anomaly (likely an infilled former watercourse) could not reasonably be identified without additional investigation in that specific location;

(d) An experienced contractor, relying on the Employer-provided geotechnical data, would not have anticipated these conditions.

3.4 A detailed technical report supporting the unforeseeability assessment is attached (Enclosure 1).

**4. Proposed Solution**

4.1 Following engineering assessment, the Contractor proposes the following solution:

(a) Install 6 additional bored piles (600mm diameter, 12m depth) in the affected area;

(b) Redesign the foundation for Pours 8, 9, and 10 as a pile-supported raft;

(c) Resequence construction to minimise programme impact.

4.2 This solution has been reviewed with the Engineer's Resident Engineer and is considered the most appropriate technical solution offering the best balance of programme, cost, and risk.

4.3 Alternative solutions considered and rejected:

| Solution | Reason for Rejection |
|----------|---------------------|
| Ground improvement (vibro-compaction) | Longer duration (20-25 days vs 12 days); uncertain effectiveness in organic soils |
| Deep excavation and replacement | Groundwater management issues; larger excavation footprint |
| Enlarged spread foundation | Inadequate bearing capacity even with enlargement |

**5. Cost**

5.1 The estimated additional cost for the proposed solution is:

| Item | Quantity | Rate (EUR) | Amount (EUR) |
|------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Additional bored piles | 6 No. | 18,500 | 111,000 |
| Pile caps/ground beams | 45 m³ | 650 | 29,250 |
| Additional rebar | 8 tonnes | 1,450 | 11,600 |
| Foundation redesign | Lump sum | - | 18,500 |
| Additional investigation | Lump sum | - | 8,200 |
| Supervision and management | Lump sum | - | 12,500 |
| **Subtotal** | | | **191,050** |
| Overhead and profit (10%) | | | 19,105 |
| **Total** | | | **210,155** |

5.2 This estimate is based on rates consistent with VO-002 (contaminated soil works) and current market rates. A detailed breakdown is provided in Enclosure 2.

**6. Programme Impact**

6.1 The additional piling works and foundation redesign will add approximately 12 working days to the HRSG foundation sequence.

6.2 After applying mitigation measures (parallel working, weekend working), the net critical path impact is 5 calendar days.

6.3 We request an Extension of Time of **5 calendar days** under Sub-Clause 4.12.

6.4 The delay analysis is provided in Enclosure 3.

**7. Summary of Request**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Additional Cost | EUR 210,155 |
| Extension of Time | 5 calendar days |

**8. Urgency**

8.1 The piling contractor is available to commence work on 12 August 2019. To maintain this mobilisation, we require Employer acknowledgement of this request by 9 August 2019.

8.2 Given the criticality of the Foundation Completion milestone, we respectfully request that this Variation be processed on an urgent basis.

8.3 We propose that works proceed immediately on a measured basis, with the Variation Order to be finalised following completion of the works.

**9. Conclusion**

9.1 The Contractor has encountered physical conditions that could not reasonably have been foreseen. These conditions require additional works to be executed at the Employer's cost and with an appropriate Extension of Time.

9.2 The Contractor has acted promptly to investigate the conditions, develop a solution, and minimise the impact on the project.

9.3 We request the Employer's urgent approval to proceed with the additional piling works and confirmation that VO-004 will be issued.

We are available to meet at short notice to discuss this request.

Yours sincerely,

**Jiří Procházka**
