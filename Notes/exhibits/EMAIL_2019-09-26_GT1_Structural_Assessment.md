**Subject:** URGENT - GT1 Foundation Slab - Structural Assessment Required
---

Wilhelm,

Further to my meeting with Ondřej this morning, I need to brief you on a potentially serious issue with the GT1 foundation slab.

**Issue Summary:**

One of six cube test samples from the GT1 foundation slab (poured 28 August) has failed the 28-day compressive strength test:

- **Sample FDN-GT1-005:** 36 MPa (vs 40 MPa minimum specified)
- Location: Western portion of slab

**Structural Context:**

The GT1 foundation slab is critical infrastructure. It supports:
- Gas turbine unit (350 tonnes)
- Inlet ductwork
- Exhaust diffuser
- Associated piping and auxiliaries

Total design load: approximately 850 tonnes uniformly distributed, plus dynamic loads from turbine operation.

**My Preliminary Assessment:**

I have reviewed the structural design calculations (DD-GT1-FDN-001). The foundation slab was designed with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Design Value | Comment |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Concrete grade | C40/50 | fck = 40 MPa |
| Slab thickness | 1,200 mm | |
| Reinforcement | B500B | Top and bottom mats |
| Bearing pressure | Max 180 kPa | On pile caps |
| Factor of safety | 1.5 (ULS) | |

The design is based on **characteristic strength (fck) of 40 MPa**. A localised area achieving only 36 MPa represents a 10% reduction in characteristic strength.

**Risk Assessment:**

| Scenario | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Single cube anomaly | Low | Cube may not represent in-situ concrete |
| Localised weakness | Medium | Area may be acceptable with reduced factor of safety |
| Systematic failure | High | Would require remediation before GT installation |

**Recommendations:**

1. **Core testing:** Extract cores from the western slab area to determine actual in-situ strength. This will confirm whether the cube result reflects the slab concrete or is an anomaly.

2. **Structural reassessment:** If cores confirm low strength, we need to assess:
   - Extent of affected area
   - Acceptability with reduced characteristic strength
   - Need for remediation (epoxy injection, additional reinforcement, partial replacement)

3. **Programme impact:** GT1 delivery is scheduled for early December (shipping October). Any major remediation could delay GT installation.

**Disclosure:**

We have a contractual obligation to notify DPI/BEU of non-conformances. However, I recommend we conduct core testing first to determine whether this is a genuine issue. If we report based solely on one failed cube test and cores subsequently pass, we will have created unnecessary concern.

Suggested timeline:
- Core drilling: 27-28 September (tomorrow/Saturday)
- Core testing: 30 September - 2 October (7-day and accelerated 28-day)
- Initial results: 3 October
- Full notification (if required): 4 October

**Urgency:**

I need your guidance on:
1. Whether to proceed with core testing before notification
2. Structural assessment parameters if cores confirm low strength
3. Remediation options to have ready

Can we convene an urgent meeting this afternoon? I suggest 16:00 in your office with Ondřej, Pavel, and Miroslav.

Regards,
