Dear Mr. Králík,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – COMMENTS ON BASELINE PROGRAMME

We have completed our review of the Baseline Programme Rev 0 submitted by letter ref. SPCC/BEU/2019/0006-PROG dated 1 March 2019.

**Overall Assessment:**

The programme demonstrates a reasonable approach to executing the Works within the Time for Completion. However, we have identified several areas requiring additional detail or clarification before we can recommend approval.

**Key Comments:**

1. **Level of Detail:** The programme shows activities at approximately 4-week duration. For a project of this scale and complexity, we recommend breaking down critical path activities to 2-week duration maximum, particularly for civil works and mechanical erection phases.

2. **Logic Links:** Some logic relationships appear optimistic. For example, the link between "Foundation Design Approval" and "Commence Piling" allows only 5 days for mobilisation. Please review and adjust where necessary.

3. **Resources:** The programme shows resource histograms but does not include productivity assumptions. Please provide basis for manpower loading, particularly peak periods.

4. **Weather Allowances:** Winter weather allowances appear adequate, but summer heat impacts on concrete works should be addressed.

5. **Commissioning Duration:** The commissioning period (4 months) appears tight for a 2-2-1 combined cycle plant. Please provide detailed commissioning sequence to support this duration.

**Detailed comments are provided in the attached review matrix (28 comments).**

Please provide revised programme addressing these comments within 21 days (by 26 March 2019).

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Heinrich Weber**  
Engineer's Representative  
Dobrić & Partners International
