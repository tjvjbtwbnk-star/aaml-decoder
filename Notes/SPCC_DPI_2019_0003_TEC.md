**3. COMMENT RESPONSES**

This submission incorporates responses to the Engineer's review comments issued on 3 April 2019 (Reference: DPI/SPCC/2019/0003). A Comment Response Schedule is attached at Appendix A, detailing how each comment has been addressed.

Of the 52 comments received:

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Category A (Major) | 12 | 10 closed; 2 held (see below) |
| Category B (Minor) | 28 | 28 closed |
| Category C (Observations) | 12 | 12 closed |

**4. OUTSTANDING COMMENTS**

Comments A-07 and A-11, relating to the GT1 foundation design and dewatering scheme respectively, remain outstanding pending resolution of the contaminated soil conditions in the Turbine Hall area.

As discussed with Ms. Kowalska on 11 April 2019, we propose to address these comments in a supplementary submission once the remediation approach and revised foundation solution for GT1 have been confirmed.

**5. GT1 FOUNDATION**

The GT1 Turbine Hall foundation design (Document BCCPP-CV-013) is not included in this submission. This document is being redesigned in light of the ground conditions discovery and will be submitted separately.

In the interim, we request that the Engineer proceeds with review of the remaining Batch 2 documents to maintain design programme progress.

**6. REVIEW PERIOD**

In accordance with Sub-Clause 5.2.2, we respectfully request the Engineer's review within 21 days of this submission (i.e., by 13 May 2019).

Given the current programme pressures, we would appreciate early notification of any significant issues that may affect approval.

**7. ELECTRONIC COPIES**

Electronic copies of all documents have been uploaded to the Project Document Management System (PDMS) under folder "Design/Basic Design/Batch 2 Rev A".

We remain available to discuss any aspects of this submission and to provide clarification as required.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr. Wilhelm Braun**
