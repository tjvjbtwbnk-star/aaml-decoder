**Subject:** Site Observations - Earthworks Commencement
---

Dear Pavel,

I completed my site inspection this afternoon following the commencement of mass earthworks in the Admin Building area. I wanted to share some observations while they are fresh.

**General:**

The mobilisation of earthworks equipment has been well-organised and the setup of the temporary haul roads is appropriate for the current volume of truck movements. The topsoil stockpile location is suitable and properly bunded.

**Positive Observations:**

1. Clear demarcation of excavation limits with survey pegs and string lines
2. Good traffic management with banksmen controlling vehicle movements
3. Dust suppression water bowser on site and being used appropriately
4. Excavation to date appears to follow approved levels
5. HSE compliance generally good - personnel wearing appropriate PPE

**Observations Requiring Attention:**

1. **Stockpile Management:** Some mixing observed between topsoil and subsoil in the eastern stockpile area. Please ensure materials are kept separate as per the approved earthworks method statement. The topsoil is to be reused for landscaping and contamination with subsoil will reduce its quality.

2. **Drainage:** With the excavation now open in the Admin Building area, I noticed some ponding in the south-west corner following yesterday evening's rain. Please ensure temporary drainage measures are in place before further deepening of the excavation.

3. **Survey Control:** I would like to see the setting-out survey data for the Admin Building excavation before we proceed much further. Can you arrange for Jan to submit the as-excavated survey at the current level (approximately -1.5m)?

4. **Exclusion Zone:** The contaminated area exclusion zone signage in the GT Hall area appears to have been disturbed (possibly by wind). Please check and reinstate as necessary.

None of these are critical issues, but please address them at your earliest convenience. I'll be conducting another inspection on Thursday.

**Productivity:**

Observed excavation rate today appeared good - approximately 450 m³ over a 6-hour shift which is in line with programme assumptions. If this rate is maintained, you should be on track for completion of Admin Building excavation by end of April.

**Civil Works Subcontractor:**

I understand BCC will be mobilising on 1 May. It would be helpful to have a joint walkover with them before they commence piling operations to ensure they understand the site conditions and any constraints.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of these observations.

Best regards,
