**Subject: Approval of Variation Order VO-001 - Additional Ground Investigation**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 13.3 (Variation Procedure); Your Ref: SPCC/BEU/2019/0012-COM dated 15 April 2019**

Dear Mr. Procházka,

**1. INTRODUCTION**

We refer to your Variation Request dated 15 April 2019 for additional ground investigation works arising from the unforeseeable ground conditions encountered in the Turbine Hall area.

The Variation has been evaluated by the Engineer in accordance with Sub-Clause 12.3, and the Employer hereby approves the Variation as set out below.

**2. VARIATION DESCRIPTION**

The Variation comprises the following works:

- Mobilisation of drilling rig for emergency investigation
- Drilling of 6 additional boreholes (BH-25 to BH-30)
- Continuous sampling and in-situ testing
- Installation of 4 piezometers
- Groundwater sampling and analysis
- Geotechnical and contamination laboratory testing
- Aquifer pumping test
- Technical reporting and interpretation

**3. ENGINEER'S EVALUATION**

3.1 The Engineer has evaluated the Variation in accordance with Sub-Clause 12.3 and recommends approval of the following value:

| Item | SPCC Claimed | Engineer Assessed | Comments |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| BGS Drilling Subcontract | 68,500 | 72,400 | Increased to reflect actual invoice |
| BETS Laboratory Testing | 24,200 | 26,800 | Additional analyses required |
| Geotechnical Lab Testing | 18,400 | 18,400 | As claimed |
| Piezometer Installation | 12,600 | 12,600 | As claimed |
| Aquifer Pumping Test | 8,800 | 9,200 | Minor rate adjustment |
| Technical Supervision | 15,400 | 18,500 | Extended duration acknowledged |
| Reporting and Interpretation | 22,500 | 24,600 | Additional contamination assessment |
| **Subtotal** | **170,400** | **182,500** | |
| Overheads and Profit (15%) | 25,560 | 27,375 | |
| **TOTAL** | **195,960** | **209,875** | |

3.2 The Engineer's evaluation exceeds the Contractor's claimed amount due to verification of actual costs incurred and acknowledgement of additional scope required for contamination assessment.

**4. APPROVED VARIATION VALUE**

The Employer approves Variation Order VO-001 in the amount of:

**EUR 245,000** (Two Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Euros)

This amount includes:
- Engineer's assessed value: EUR 209,875
- Contingency for minor scope variations: EUR 35,125

The contingency is included to cover any minor additional works that may have been undertaken but not fully captured in the submission. This avoids the need for supplementary claims for minor items.

**5. EXTENSION OF TIME**

No Extension of Time is granted in connection with VO-001. The additional ground investigation was undertaken in parallel with ongoing works and did not extend the critical path.

Any Extension of Time arising from the underlying ground conditions (DE-002) will be addressed separately.

**6. CONTRACT PRICE ADJUSTMENT**

The Contract Price is hereby adjusted as follows:

| | EUR |
|---|---:|
| Original Contract Price | 847,500,000 |
| VO-001 - Additional Ground Investigation | +245,000 |
| **Revised Contract Price** | **847,745,000** |

**7. PAYMENT**

The approved Variation amount will be included in the next Interim Payment Certificate following receipt of the Contractor's application.

**8. DOCUMENTATION**

Please ensure that all supporting documentation (invoices, records, certificates) is retained and available for audit purposes.

**9. CONFIRMATION**

Please confirm your acceptance of this Variation Order within 7 days of this letter.

Yours sincerely,

**Ana Nikolić**
