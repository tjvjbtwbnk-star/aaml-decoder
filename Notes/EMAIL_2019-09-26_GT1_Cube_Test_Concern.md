**Subject:** GT1 Foundation Slab - Cube Test Results Query
---

Andrej,

I have been reviewing the complete set of cube test results for the GT1 foundation slab (poured 28 August) and have identified something that needs your input.

**Background:**

The GT1 foundation slab was poured using C40/50 concrete with high-early-strength characteristics. The total pour volume was 420 m³.

**Cube Test Results:**

| Sample Location | 7-day (MPa) | 28-day (MPa) | Target 28-day | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| FDN-GT1-001 (North) | 45 | 52 | 40 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-002 (East) | 48 | 55 | 40 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-003 (Centre) | 42 | 51 | 40 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-004 (South) | 38 | 47 | 40 | Pass |
| **FDN-GT1-005 (West)** | **32** | **36** | **40** | **FAIL** |
| FDN-GT1-006 (SW corner) | 44 | 53 | 40 | Pass |

**Issue:**

Sample FDN-GT1-005 from the western area of the slab has failed the 28-day compressive strength test. The result of **36 MPa** is below the specified minimum of **40 MPa**.

**Initial Analysis:**

I have checked the following:
- Cube casting was witnessed by DPI (Maria Santos present)
- Cubes were stored and cured in accordance with procedure
- Testing was conducted at an accredited laboratory (Szohôd Materials Testing)
- Laboratory calibration certificates are current

The low result appears genuine and is not a testing error.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Localised water addition:** Additional water may have been added to improve workability during the pour. The west area was one of the last sections poured.

2. **Delayed placement:** The pour took 11 hours (vs 8 planned) due to concrete supply issues (see T. Polák email 28 August). The west area concrete may have begun to set before vibration.

3. **Inadequate compaction:** The west area is near the slab edge where vibrator access may have been limited.

4. **Mix variation:** Possible batch variation from the concrete supplier.

**Questions for You:**

1. What is the structural significance of this result? The GT1 foundation slab carries the gas turbine (approximately 350 tonnes). Is a localised area at 36 MPa acceptable?

2. Do we need to conduct additional investigation (cores from the slab)?

3. What are the repair/remediation options if the in-situ strength is confirmed as substandard?

**Immediate Actions:**

I have not yet reported this externally. Before we notify DPI and BEU, I want to understand the structural implications and our options.

I have quarantined the test certificates pending your review.

Can we meet this morning to discuss?

Regards,
