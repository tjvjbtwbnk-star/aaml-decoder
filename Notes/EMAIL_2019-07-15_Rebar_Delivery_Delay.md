**Subject:** URGENT: Rebar Delivery Delay Notification - Batch 8
---

Dear Tomáš,

I am writing to urgently notify you that we have received information from Balkan Steel Structures that the rebar delivery for Batch 8 will be delayed.

**Original Schedule:**
- Delivery Date: Tuesday 16 July 2019
- Quantity: 48 tonnes (mixed diameters 16mm, 20mm, 25mm, 32mm)
- Destination: BCCPP Site, Laydown Area C

**Revised Schedule:**
- New Delivery Date: Thursday 18 July 2019
- Quantity: Unchanged
- Reason: Transport vehicle breakdown, replacement truck being arranged

**Impact Assessment:**

I have reviewed our current stock position and work programme:

| Diameter | Current Stock (tonnes) | Daily Usage (tonnes) | Days Coverage |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 16mm | 8.5 | 2.2 | 3.9 |
| 20mm | 6.2 | 1.8 | 3.4 |
| 25mm | 4.8 | 1.5 | 3.2 |
| 32mm | 3.1 | 0.9 | 3.4 |

Based on the above, we have approximately 3 days of stock at current usage rates. The 2-day delay will therefore cause the following impacts:

1. **HRSG Pour 6 preparation:** Currently scheduled to commence rebar installation 17 July. This will be delayed by 1 day minimum.

2. **Cooling Tower Pour 3:** Scheduled 16 July – sufficient rebar in stock for this pour. No impact.

3. **Admin Building:** Complete – no impact.

**Proposed Mitigation:**

1. Prioritise 32mm bar usage to GT1 pile cap preparation (critical path activity)
2. Reduce wastage through improved cutting schedules – I am reviewing bar schedules today
3. Request partial early delivery of most critical sizes (32mm) if possible

I have asked Mr. Đurić to contact Balkan Steel to see if a partial delivery tomorrow (16 July) is possible for the 32mm bars only, as these are most critical for the GT1 works.

**Action Required:**

1. Please confirm you agree with the proposed prioritisation
2. Please advise if any activities should be re-sequenced
3. SPCC procurement to contact Balkan Steel to expedite or arrange partial delivery

I apologise for this disruption. We are doing everything possible to minimise the impact. I will provide an update by end of day today on the outcome of discussions with Balkan Steel.

Regards,
