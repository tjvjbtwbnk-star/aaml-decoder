# TECHNICAL NOTE

| | |
|---|---|
| **Report No.:** | TR-003 |
| **Title:** | Unexpected Subsurface Conditions - GT Hall Area |
| **Date:** | 29 March 2019 |
| **Prepared by:** | Andrej Kováč, Lead Civil Engineer (SPCC) |
| **Reviewed by:** | Dr. Wilhelm Braun, Engineering Manager (SPCC) |
| **Project:** | Borduria Combined Cycle Power Plant |

## 1. PURPOSE

This technical note documents unexpected subsurface conditions discovered in the Gas Turbine Hall foundation area during geotechnical investigation and provides preliminary assessment of implications.

---

## 2. BACKGROUND

### 2.1 Contract Information

The Contract included preliminary site investigation data (2017) indicating:
- Groundwater table at 8-9m below ground surface
- Typical soil profile: Clay overlying sand
- No indication of perched water or artesian conditions

### 2.2 Current Investigation

SPCC conducted comprehensive ground investigation (24 boreholes, 15-35m depth) from 18 February to 8 March 2019. Final laboratory testing completed 25 March 2019.

---

## 3. FINDINGS

### 3.1 Perched Water Table - GT Hall Area

**Location:** Boreholes BH-01, BH-02, BH-16 (Gas Turbine Hall foundation area)

**Observation:** Water table at 5.2-6.0m depth (versus 8-9m expected based on Contract data)

**Extent:** Affects GT Hall foundation footprint (~80m x 40m area). Not observed in other site areas.

### 3.2 Confined Sand Lens

**Stratigraphy:**
- 0-5.5m: Sandy clay (low permeability: k = 2 x 10⁻⁸ m/s)
- 5.5-8m: Medium sand (high permeability: k = 5 x 10⁻⁴ m/s) - SATURATED
- 8m+: Sandy clay and gravelly sand

**Characteristics:**
- Continuous high-permeability layer acting as confined aquifer
- Overlying and underlying clay creates confining conditions
- Water trapped under pressure

### 3.3 Artesian Pressure

**Observation:** When boreholes penetrated the sand lens:
- Water rapidly rose 2-3m above static level
- Indicates significant confined pressure
- Hydraulic head approximately 3m above sand lens

**Implications:** Excavation into sand lens will cause:
- Upward water flow (base heave risk)
- Piping and instability
- Potential foundation uplift

---

## 4. COMPARISON TO CONTRACT DATA

| Parameter | Contract Data (2017) | Current Finding (2019) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Water table depth | 8-9m | 5-6m (GT Hall area) |
| Condition | Normal water table | Perched/confined aquifer |
| Pressure | Hydrostatic | Artesian (+2-3m head) |
| Permeability | Not specified | High (5 x 10⁻⁴ m/s in sand) |

**Conclusion:** Conditions are materially different from Contract information.

---

## 5. DESIGN IMPLICATIONS

### 5.1 Foundation Design

**Original Design Basis:**
- Shallow foundations at 4.5-5.5m depth
- Standard waterproofing
- Assumed hydrostatic water pressure from 8m depth

**Required Changes:**
- Foundations will intercept perched water at 5-6m
- Must resist artesian uplift pressure
- Options: Deeper/heavier foundations, piled foundations, or pressure relief system

**Cost Impact:** EUR 500,000 - 1,200,000 (preliminary)

### 5.2 Dewatering Requirements

**Original Assumption:**
- Wellpoint dewatering
- 20-30 m³/hr capacity
- 4-6 months duration
- Cost: ~EUR 80,000

**Actual Requirement:**
- Deep well system (8-12 wells)
- 100-150 m³/hr capacity
- Pressure relief wells
- 8-12 months duration
- Specialist contractor
- Cost: ~EUR 350,000-450,000

**Additional Cost:** EUR 270,000-370,000

### 5.3 Programme Impact

**Additional Time Required:**
- Dewatering design and procurement: 6-8 weeks
- Deep well installation: 4-6 weeks
- Pre-drainage: 6-8 weeks
- Extended pumping: 2-4 months

**Total Delay:** 12-18 weeks to GT Hall foundation start

## 6. WHY CONDITIONS ARE UNFORESEEABLE

1. **Limited Contract Data:** 2017 investigation had only 4 boreholes to 10m depth, not in GT Hall location

2. **Localized Feature:** Perched water specific to GT Hall area, not representative of site

3. **Materially Different:** Actual conditions (perched/artesian at 5-6m) significantly different from Contract (normal water table at 8-9m)

4. **Not Reasonably Foreseeable:** An experienced contractor could not have anticipated this localized geological feature based on preliminary data provided

---

## 7. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Hydrogeological Study:** Detailed assessment of sand lens extent and recharge (completion 10 April)

2. **Foundation Design:** Evaluate alternatives (deeper foundations, piles, pressure relief)

3. **Dewatering Design:** Engage specialist contractor, design deep well system

4. **Environmental:** Assess permit requirements for increased discharge

5. **Programme:** Detailed schedule impact analysis and mitigation options

6. **Commercial:** Sub-Clause 4.12 notice issued 28 March 2019

## 8. PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATE

| Item | Cost (EUR) |
|------|-----------|
| Foundation design changes | 500,000 - 1,200,000 |
| Enhanced dewatering | 270,000 - 370,000 |
| Additional investigations | 80,000 - 120,000 |
| Environmental/permitting | 20,000 - 40,000 |
| **Subtotal** | **870,000 - 1,730,000** |
| Potential scope changes | 500,000 - 2,000,000 |
| **Total Range** | **1,370,000 - 3,730,000** |

## 9. RECOMMENDATION

Urgent meeting required with BEU, Engineer, and SPCC technical teams to:
- Review technical findings
- Agree foundation design approach
- Approve dewatering strategy
- Establish programme mitigation measures
- Discuss contractual/commercial implications

**Target Meeting Date:** Week of 1-5 April 2019
