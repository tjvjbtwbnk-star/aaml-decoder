---

Dear Dragan,

Following our discussion at WPM-012 yesterday and the TCM-002 decision on the GT1 foundation solution, I wanted to provide a more detailed technical briefing on the foundation design implications arising from the ground conditions discovery.

**GT1 FOUNDATION REDESIGN:**

As agreed at TCM-002, we are proceeding with Option 1 (Deep Bored Piles) for the GT1 foundation. Key parameters:

| Parameter | Original Design | Revised Design |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Foundation Type | Piled raft | Piled raft |
| Pile Type | Driven precast | Bored cast-in-situ |
| Pile Diameter | 450mm | 750mm |
| Pile Length | 12-14m | 28-32m |
| Number of Piles | 36 | 28 |
| Founding Stratum | Medium dense sand (8-10m) | Dense sand (30-35m) |

The change from driven to bored piles is necessary to penetrate the contaminated zone and artesian aquifer without creating migration pathways. The larger diameter compensates for the reduced pile count and provides better load distribution.

**Programme Implications:**

The revised piling approach has the following programme implications:

1. **Piling Duration:** Bored piles take longer to install than driven piles
   - Original estimate: 18 days for 36 driven piles
   - Revised estimate: 28 days for 28 bored piles
   - Additional duration: 10 days

2. **Pile Cap Concrete:** Larger pile cap required due to changed load distribution
   - Original: 680 m³ concrete
   - Revised: 820 m³ concrete
   - Additional duration: 3 days

3. **Curing Time:** Deep bored piles require longer curing before load testing
   - Original: 7 days
   - Revised: 14 days
   - Additional duration: 7 days

**Total additional duration for GT1 foundation: 20 days**

This is in addition to the time required for contamination remediation (6-7 weeks).

**Design Development Status:**

I am developing the detailed GT1 foundation design with target submission dates as follows:

| Deliverable | Target Date |
|-------------|-------------|
| Preliminary pile layout | 17 May 2019 |
| Structural calculations | 24 May 2019 |
| Foundation drawings (IFC) | 31 May 2019 |
| Pile working platform design | 17 May 2019 |

**Interface with Remediation:**

The foundation design is being coordinated with the remediation works:

1. Remediation excavation depth (6.7m) provides the pile working platform level
2. Backfill specification coordinated with pile installation requirements
3. Groundwater control system designed for both remediation and piling phases

**Cost Implications:**

I am preparing a cost comparison between original and revised foundation designs for inclusion in the DE-002 claim. Preliminary assessment indicates additional cost of approximately EUR 850,000 - 1,100,000 comprising:

- Bored piling (vs driven): +EUR 420,000
- Additional pile cap concrete and reinforcement: +EUR 180,000
- Extended dewatering: +EUR 120,000
- Additional design effort: +EUR 85,000
- Extended preliminaries: TBD (dependent on programme)

These figures are preliminary and will be refined as detailed design progresses.

**Coordination Required:**

To maintain progress, I need the following from BEU:

1. Confirmation of methodology approval for remediation (expected 10 May)
2. Any comments on the preliminary pile layout by 24 May
3. Confirmation of any BEU-specific requirements for the GT1 foundation (e.g., future maintenance access, monitoring provisions)

I am available to discuss any aspects of this technical briefing at your convenience.

Best regards,
