## Minutes

### 1. Review of Previous Minutes and Actions

The minutes of WPM-022 dated 24 July 2019 were approved without amendment.

**Action Review:**

| Action | Description | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| WPM-022/01 | Night shift supervision matrix to BEU | P. Horváth | Closed |
| WPM-022/02 | Transmit updated seismic analysis to BEU | A. Kováč | Closed |
| WPM-022/03 | Ground conditions technical note (GT1 piling) | A. Kováč | Closed |
| WPM-020/01 | Weekly heat stress summary to BEU | P. Horváth | Ongoing |

### 2. Safety Report

P. Horváth reported:

- No lost time incidents during the week
- Total man-hours worked: 15,800 (highest week to date due to recovery activities)
- Near-misses: One incident on 5 August – excavator bucket contacted formwork stack. No injuries. Exclusion zone procedures reinforced.
- Heat stress: Two minor cases, both returned to work same day
- Night operations continuing for GT1 pile cap – enhanced lighting and supervision effective

I. Petrović (BEU) noted the increased man-hours and enquired about fatigue management. P. Horváth confirmed that personnel working night shifts are rostered to ensure adequate rest periods, with a maximum of 5 consecutive night shifts allowed.

### 3. HRSG Unforeseen Ground Conditions Update

A. Kováč presented the situation regarding the unforeseen ground conditions discovered on 2 August 2019:

**Summary:**
- Location: HRSG Foundation area, Grid Lines H4-H6
- Issue: Soft organic clay with high groundwater instead of expected medium dense sand
- Extent: Determined through additional investigation (3 boreholes drilled 3-4 August)
- Affected area: Approximately 400 m² affecting Pours 8, 9, and 10

**Investigation Results:**

| Borehole | Depth to competent stratum | Notes |
|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| BH-A1 | 8.2m | Organic clay layer 3.0-6.5m |
| BH-A2 | 7.8m | Similar profile |
| BH-A3 | 9.1m | Deepest extent at edge of affected zone |

**Proposed Solution:**
- Install 6 additional bored piles (600mm diameter, 12m depth)
- Redesign foundation as pile-supported raft for affected pours
- Piling contractor (same as GT1) available from 12 August

**Programme Impact:**
- Additional 12 working days for piling and foundation works
- Net delay to Foundation Completion milestone: 5 days (after recovery measures)

I. Petrović (BEU) asked for confirmation that this issue was not identifiable from the original ground investigation. A. Kováč confirmed that the original geotechnical report (BGS GEO-2019-001) showed consistent sand conditions across the site and that this localised anomaly was not detectable from the borehole locations used.

M. Santos (DPI) confirmed she witnessed the conditions and concurred that they differ materially from the geotechnical report.

I. Petrović stated that BEU will review the matter carefully but acknowledged that the conditions appear to be unforeseen.

**Action:** A. Kováč to provide formal technical report on HRSG ground conditions to support claim.

### 4. Construction Progress

P. Novotný reported:

**4.1 GT1 Pile Cap**
- Pour 1: Complete (1 August)
- Pour 2: Pour today following pre-pour inspection this morning (cleared by DPI)
- Pour 3: Scheduled 12 August
- Foundation slab: Scheduled 19 August
- Overall: On track for 28 August completion

M. Santos confirmed Pour 2 inspection was satisfactory following rectification of items noted in her email yesterday.

**4.2 HRSG Foundations**
- Pours 1-7: Complete (58%)
- Pour 8: On hold pending piling solution
- Pour 9: On hold
- Pour 10: On hold
- Remaining pours (11-12): Unaffected, can proceed in parallel

**4.3 Cooling Tower**
- Pour 6: Complete (5 August)

| HRSG | 58% | 42% | Delayed (ground conditions) |
| Cooling Tower | 75% | 25% | On track |
| Admin Building | 100% | 0% | Complete |

### 5. Programme Update – Recovery Programme

M. Dvořák presented the Recovery Programme status:

**Recovery Programme Submission:**

| HRSG Complete | - | 6 Sep | +12 days (ground conditions) |
| CT Complete | - | 30 Aug | On track |
| **Foundation Completion** | **1 Sep** | **6 Sep** | **+5 days** |

I. Petrović (BEU) stated that BEU is reviewing the Recovery Programme and will provide comments by 12 August. She acknowledged the HRSG ground conditions issue but reserved BEU's position on whether this constitutes an Employer risk event.

**Action:** BEU to provide comments on Recovery Programme by 12 August.
