## 3. Background

### 3.1 Discovery Chronology

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 27-29 Mar 2019 | Artesian aquifer discovered during GI works |
| 1-2 Apr 2019 | Additional boreholes (BH-25 to BH-30) drilled to delineate aquifer extent |
| 2 Apr 2019 | Anomalous soil colouration and odour noted in BH-26, BH-27, BH-28 |
| 3 Apr 2019 | Soil samples submitted to BETS laboratory for analysis |
| 5 Apr 2019 | Laboratory results received confirming hydrocarbon contamination |
| 6-7 Apr 2019 | Additional delineation sampling conducted |

### 3.2 Site History

Research of Municipal Archive records revealed the following historical land use:

- **1952-1965:** Undeveloped agricultural land
- **1965-1987:** Borduria State Petroleum Depot - bulk fuel storage and distribution facility serving agricultural machinery fleet
- **1987-2003:** Abandoned/derelict
- **2003-2018:** General industrial storage (various tenants)
- **2018-present:** Acquired by BEU for power plant development

The fuel storage depot operated for 22 years and included underground storage tanks and above-ground fuel handling infrastructure. Records indicate the facility was decommissioned without formal environmental assessment or remediation.

### 3.3 Tender Information Review

The Contractor has reviewed the Site information provided by the Employer at tender stage. The following documents were provided:

- Topographic Survey (2017)
- Geotechnical Desktop Study (2016)
- Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (2017)

The Phase 1 ESA identified the historical fuel depot use and noted "potential for subsurface contamination" as a "moderate risk" requiring "further investigation during detailed design." However, no Phase 2 intrusive investigation was conducted prior to Contract award.

## 4. Investigation Methodology

### 4.1 Borehole Programme

Six additional boreholes (BH-25 to BH-30) were drilled to supplement the original 24-borehole programme. Drilling was conducted using cable percussion methods with continuous sampling.

### 4.2 Sampling Protocol

Soil samples were collected at 0.5m intervals through the contaminated zone. Standard chain of custody procedures were followed. Samples were submitted to BETS Laboratory (accredited to ISO 17025) for analysis.

### 4.3 Analytical Suite

- Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) - GC-FID method
- BTEX compounds (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylenes)
- Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)
- Heavy metals suite

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Contamination Concentrations

| Borehole | Depth (m) | TPH (mg/kg) | Benzene (mg/kg) | PAH Total (mg/kg) |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| BH-25 | 3.5-6.0 | 420 | <0.05 | 12 |
| BH-26 | 3.5-6.2 | 2,850 | 0.8 | 145 |
| BH-27 | 4.0-6.0 | 4,120 | 1.2 | 210 |
| BH-28 | 3.8-5.5 | 1,940 | 0.4 | 89 |
| BH-29 | 4.0-5.5 | 680 | <0.05 | 28 |
| BH-30 | 3.5-5.0 | 310 | <0.05 | 8 |

**Regulatory Limits (Bordurian Industrial Land Standards):**
- TPH: 1,000 mg/kg
- Benzene: 1.0 mg/kg
- PAH Total: 100 mg/kg

### 5.2 Contamination Extent

Based on interpolation of borehole data, the contaminated zone (exceeding regulatory limits) is estimated at:

- **Plan area:** 3,200 m² (approximately 80m x 40m)
- **Depth range:** 3.5m to 6.2m below ground level
- **Average thickness:** 1.7m
- **Estimated volume:** 5,100 m³

### 5.3 Groundwater

Groundwater samples from the perched aquifer show TPH concentrations of 0.8-2.1 mg/L, exceeding the Bordurian groundwater standard of 0.5 mg/L. This confirms that the contamination has migrated to groundwater.

## 6. Risk Assessment

### 6.1 Human Health Risks

- **Construction workers:** Moderate risk from dermal contact and inhalation during excavation
- **Future site users:** Low risk (contamination will be removed during construction)
- **Mitigation required:** PPE, air monitoring, exclusion zones during excavation

### 6.2 Environmental Risks

- **Groundwater:** Contaminated groundwater cannot be discharged without treatment
- **Surface water:** Risk of contaminated runoff if improperly managed
- **Soil migration:** Limited risk - clay layers confine contamination

### 6.3 Regulatory Compliance

The contamination exceeds Bordurian regulatory limits. Under the Environmental Protection Regulations 2015:
- Notification to EPA required within 14 days of confirmation
- Remediation required prior to development
- Disposal at licensed hazardous waste facility required

## 7. Impact on the Works

### 7.1 Affected Areas

The contaminated zone underlies a significant portion of the GT1 Turbine Hall foundation, specifically:
- GT1 foundation block (partial)
- GT1 pedestal area
- Adjacent cable trenches
- Portions of HRSG1 foundation

### 7.2 Programme Impact

Foundation construction in the GT1 area cannot proceed until contamination is addressed. Preliminary programme assessment indicates:

| Activity | Original Start | Revised Start | Delay |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| GT1 Foundation Excavation | 15 May 2019 | 15 Jul 2019 | 61 days |
| GT1 Foundation Pour | 10 Jun 2019 | 10 Aug 2019 | 61 days |
| Piling - GT1 Area | 1 May 2019 | 25 Jun 2019 | 55 days |

A full programme impact assessment will be submitted separately following determination of the remediation approach.

### 7.3 Cost Impact

Preliminary cost assessment for contaminated soil management:

| Item | Estimated Cost (EUR) |
|------|---------------------|
| Additional investigation/delineation | 45,000 |
| Excavation of contaminated soil | 180,000 |
| Disposal at licensed facility | 510,000 |
| Groundwater treatment (dewatering) | 120,000 |
| Backfill with clean material | 95,000 |
| Environmental monitoring/compliance | 35,000 |
| Contractor's preliminaries extension | TBD |
| **Subtotal (Direct Costs)** | **985,000** |

This is a preliminary estimate subject to detailed assessment and does not include delay costs or impacts on other works.

## 8. Remediation Options

### 8.1 Option A: Excavation and Off-Site Disposal (Recommended)

- Complete excavation of contaminated soil to below regulatory limits
- Disposal at Szohôd Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility (licensed)
- Backfill with certified clean material
- Duration: 8-10 weeks
- Certainty: High

### 8.2 Option B: In-Situ Treatment

- Bioremediation using enhanced natural attenuation
- Lower capital cost but extended duration (6-12 months)
- Regulatory acceptance uncertain
- Not recommended for this project timeline

### 8.3 Option C: Encapsulation

- Contain contamination beneath impermeable cap
- Foundation design modification required
- Long-term monitoring obligations
- May not achieve regulatory approval

## 9. Conclusions

1. Soil contamination in the GT1 Turbine Hall area has been confirmed, with TPH levels up to four times regulatory limits.

2. The contamination was not foreseeable from the tender documents and constitutes an unforeseeable physical condition under Sub-Clause 4.12.

3. The contaminated zone affects approximately 5,100 m³ of soil within the foundation excavation zone.

4. Remediation is required before foundation construction can proceed in this area.

5. Programme delays of 8-10 weeks in the GT1 area are anticipated.

---

## 10. Recommendations

1. **Regulatory Notification:** BEU to notify Bordurian EPA within 14 days of this report.

2. **Remediation Approach:** Proceed with Option A (Excavation and Off-Site Disposal) subject to Employer instruction.

3. **Variation Request:** SPCC to submit formal Variation request for contaminated soil management works.

4. **Programme:** SPCC to submit revised programme incorporating remediation works.

5. **Risk Management:** Implement immediate measures for worker protection during any works in contaminated zone.
