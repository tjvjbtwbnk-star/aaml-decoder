**Subject:** Grid Data Delay - Design Impact Assessment
---

Sophie,

I have received BEU's letter regarding the grid connection data (BEU/SPCC/2019/0020-TEC dated 15 August). I need you to prepare the requested assessment by 22 August.

However, I also want us to prepare a formal notice under Sub-Clause 1.9. The Employer's letter attempts to shift responsibility to us, but I believe this is incorrect. Let me explain my thinking.

**1. Contractual Analysis**

BEU cites Sub-Clause 5.1 (Contractor's design responsibility). However, they are ignoring Sub-Clause 1.9 which states:

*"The Employer shall... give notice to the Contractor of any information... which is necessary for the execution of the Works... within a time which gives the Contractor reasonable time to perform his obligations."*

The grid connection data is Employer-provided information necessary for the design. We cannot design the protection system without knowing what we are protecting against. This is not a matter of "reasonable assumptions" – it is fundamental design data.

**2. Programme Impact**

Based on my review, the delayed grid data has the following impact:

| Design Element | % of Electrical Scope | Impact |
|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| Protection system design | 15% | Cannot finalise |
| Power quality equipment | 5% | Cannot finalise |
| Control system interfaces | 8% | Cannot finalise |
| **Total affected** | **28%** | |

Current electrical detailed design progress: 27%
Progress without grid data constraint: Would be ~38-40%

**Delay assessment:** Approximately 3 weeks of electrical design progress has been lost.

**3. Downstream Impact**

More concerning is the impact on GT commissioning. TurboMach requires confirmed protection settings by 31 August to complete their control software. If we cannot provide this:

- Control software completion delayed
- GT commissioning procedures cannot be finalised  
- First fire potentially delayed

I estimate the knock-on impact could be 4-6 weeks on the commissioning programme if the data arrives on 30 August as BEU now indicates.

**4. Action Required**

Please prepare the following:

**4.1 Response to BEU (by 22 August):**
- List of design assumptions being used
- Risk assessment (HIGH – assumptions may not match actual grid conditions)
- List of decisions that cannot be made (protection relay settings, harmonic filter sizing, AVR parameters)
- Programme impact assessment

**4.2 For Jiří (by 20 August):**
- Supporting technical memorandum for Sub-Clause 1.9 notice
- Preliminary delay analysis
- Cost impact assessment (design resource standing time)

**5. My View**

BEU's position that we should proceed with "reasonable assumptions" and adjust later is not acceptable for safety-critical protection systems. We cannot guess at fault levels for protection coordination. If we get it wrong:

- Equipment damage during faults
- Failure to disconnect during grid disturbances
- Safety risk to personnel
- Grid code non-compliance

I intend to recommend that we submit a formal notice on 22 August if the data is not received by then. This protects our position while allowing BEU a few more days to deliver.

Please coordinate with Marek on the control system implications for TurboMach.

I am available to discuss on Monday.

Regards,
