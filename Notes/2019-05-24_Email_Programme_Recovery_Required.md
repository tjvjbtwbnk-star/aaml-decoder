Dear Miroslav,

As we approach PMM-005 on Monday, I wanted to share some thoughts on the programme status and the recovery measures that BEU considers necessary to bring the project back on track.

**Current Situation:**

While I acknowledge the recent improvements (SPI now 0.94, float recovered to 9 days), the overall position remains concerning:

- Basic Design Approval will be 58 days late (12 June vs 15 April)
- Foundation completion forecast at 20 October vs 1 September (49 days late)
- Only 9 days float remaining with 44 months of work ahead

The original programme had 15 days float, which was already tight for a project of this complexity. We are now operating with significantly reduced margin for any further issues.

**BEU's Concerns:**

1. **Design Approval Delay:** While the Design Task Force is helping, the fact remains that Basic Design approval will be nearly two months late. This has consumed most of the available float.

2. **Ground Conditions Impact:** The contaminated soil situation, while being managed effectively, will add further delay to GT1 foundation. Your forecast shows GT1 piling complete on 2 August - this was originally planned for mid-June.

3. **Cumulative Effect:** The delay is not limited to one area - it is spreading across multiple fronts. This increases the risk of delays compounding.

4. **Recovery Sustainability:** The current recovery measures (extended hours, additional resources) cannot be maintained indefinitely. At some point, fatigue and diminishing returns will set in.

**Recovery Measures Expected:**

For PMM-005, I would like SPCC to present a comprehensive recovery plan that addresses the following:

1. **Design Completion:**
   - Accelerated Detailed Design development
   - Additional design resources if required
   - Realistic schedule for design completion

2. **Construction Acceleration:**
   - Consideration of additional shifts (night work) for critical activities
   - Additional equipment/resources where beneficial
   - Optimised construction sequencing

3. **Procurement:**
   - Status of all long-lead items
   - Mitigation of HRSG schedule risk (flagged by your procurement team)
   - Expediting of any delayed items

4. **Critical Path Protection:**
   - Clear identification of critical and near-critical activities
   - Specific mitigation measures for each
   - Contingency planning for potential issues

5. **Milestone Commitments:**
   - Revised milestone dates with high confidence
   - Any EOT claimed should be reflected in the programme

**Commercial Perspective:**

I want to be clear that BEU is not seeking to impose unreasonable acceleration at SPCC's cost. Where delays are attributable to Employer risk events (DE-001, DE-002), appropriate EOT will be granted.

However, BEU expects SPCC to:
- Take all reasonable measures to minimise delay
- Not allow claimed events to become an excuse for underperformance in other areas
- Maintain the recovery momentum achieved in recent weeks

**Taking Over Date:**

At this stage, BEU remains focused on the Taking Over date of 14 January 2023. We recognise that there are open claims that may affect this date, but until those are determined, the contractual date remains the target.

I understand this email may come across as demanding, but I hope you appreciate that it reflects BEU's genuine concern for project success. We have a shared interest in delivering this plant on time and to specification.

I look forward to a productive discussion at PMM-005.

Best regards,
