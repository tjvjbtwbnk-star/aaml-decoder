# INCIDENT REPORT

| | |
|---|---|
| **Report No.:** | IR-2019-008 |
| **Date of Incident:** | Wednesday, 18 September 2019 |
| **Time of Incident:** | 14:35 |
| **Location:** | HRSG Area, Grid Line H6 |
| **Report Date:** | 18 September 2019 |
| **Prepared by:** | Peter Horváth, HSE Manager |
| **Classification:** | **RECORDABLE INCIDENT – Medical Treatment Case** |

## 1. Incident Summary

During structural steel erection at the HRSG area, a steel beam slipped during lifting, striking the edge of a temporary platform and causing debris to fall onto two workers below. Both workers sustained minor injuries requiring first aid and medical evaluation. No lost time resulted.

## 2. Incident Details

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Date | 18 September 2019 |
| Time | 14:35 |
| Location | HRSG Area, Grid Line H6 |
| Weather | Overcast, light wind (8 km/h), dry |
| Activity | Structural steel beam erection |
| Equipment | Liebherr LTM 1100 mobile crane |
| Crane operator | Milan Krstić (BCC) |
| Rigger/Signaller | Dejan Marković (BCC) |

## 3. Description of Incident

### 3.1 Sequence of Events

**14:20** - Lifting operation commenced for steel beam B-H6-04 (W360x51, 8.2m length, approximately 420 kg). The beam was being lifted from the laydown area to the HRSG steel frame at elevation +6.0m.

**14:30** - Beam lifted clear of ground and slewed towards the installation position. Signaller positioned at installation point.

**14:33** - Beam positioned above installation location. Ironworkers (2 No. from Balkan Steel Structures) positioned on temporary work platform at +6.0m to receive the beam.

**14:34** - During final positioning, the rigging sling shifted on the beam flange. The beam rotated approximately 30 degrees, causing one end to swing outward.

**14:35** - The swinging beam contacted the edge of the temporary work platform, dislodging a scaffold board and several small items (bolts, tools). The debris fell approximately 6 metres to the ground level.

**14:35** - Two workers (J. Novák and P. Stanković, both BCC labourers) were standing in the exclusion zone perimeter but within the fall radius of debris. Both were struck by falling items.

**14:36** - Crane operator immediately held the load. Signaller called "All Stop." Site first aiders responded.

**14:40** - First aid administered. Both workers conscious and ambulatory.

### 3.2 Injuries

| Worker | Company | Injury | Treatment | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Jan Novák | BCC | Laceration to left forearm (falling bolt) | First aid, 4 stitches at site medical | Returned to light duties 19 Sep |
| Petar Stanković | BCC | Bruising to right shoulder (falling board) | First aid, medical evaluation | Returned to normal duties 19 Sep |

### 3.3 Damage

| Item | Description | Estimated Cost |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Scaffold board | Damaged beyond repair | EUR 50 |
| Steel beam | Minor scraping to flange – acceptable | EUR 0 |
| Tools | Minor damage | EUR 100 |

## 4. Immediate Actions Taken

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 14:36 | Lifting operations suspended |
| 14:40 | First aid administered |
| 14:45 | Area secured |
| 14:50 | Workers transported to site medical facility |
| 15:00 | Incident reported to SPCC Construction Manager |
| 15:15 | Workers transported to Szohôd General Hospital for evaluation |
| 15:30 | Crane and rigging inspected – no defects found |
| 16:00 | BEU Site Representative notified |
| 17:00 | Workers returned to site – cleared for light/normal duties |
| 17:30 | Incident investigation commenced |

## 5. Investigation

### 5.1 Investigation Team

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| Peter Horváth | HSE Manager (Lead) |
| Pavel Novotný | Construction Manager |
| Goran Stanković | BCC Site Foreman |
| Branko Simić | BEU Site Representative (Observer) |

### 5.2 Root Cause Analysis

**Immediate Cause:**
Rigging sling shifted on beam flange during positioning, causing load rotation.

**Contributing Factors:**

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1. Rigging configuration | Single-point lift using one sling. Beam centre of gravity not aligned with lift point. |
| 2. Sling condition | Sling in acceptable condition but some wear noted on edge protector. |
| 3. Lift planning | Lift plan specified two-point lift for beams >400kg. This was not followed. |
| 4. Supervision | BSS rigger not present – BCC rigger performed lift outside his competence. |
| 5. Exclusion zone | Zone established but workers had entered perimeter during lift duration. |

**Root Causes:**

1. **Failure to follow lift plan:** The approved lift plan specified a two-point lift using two slings with spreader beam. The rigger used a single sling, creating an unstable lift.

2. **Inadequate supervision:** The Balkan Steel Structures appointed rigger was absent (comfort break). The BCC rigger proceeded with the lift without proper authorisation.

3. **Exclusion zone breach:** Workers entered the exclusion zone perimeter, likely because the lift had been in progress for some time and they assumed it was safe.

### 5.3 Classification

This incident is classified as a **Medical Treatment Case (MTC)** under OSHA recordability criteria:
- Injuries required medical treatment beyond first aid (stitches)
- No lost time – both workers returned to work

This is SPCC's first recordable incident on the project.

## 6. Corrective Actions

| No. | Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|-----|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Suspend lifting operations pending investigation | P. Horváth | 18 Sep | Complete |
| 2 | Reinspect all rigging equipment | T. Polák | 19 Sep | Complete |
| 3 | Retrain all riggers on lift planning requirements | P. Horváth | 20 Sep | In progress |
| 4 | Implement "two-person" rule for all lifts >300kg | P. Novotný | Immediate | Complete |
| 5 | Install physical barriers at exclusion zones | T. Polák | 23 Sep | In progress |
| 6 | Disciplinary review – BCC rigger | G. Stanković (BCC) | 20 Sep | In progress |
| 7 | Issue safety alert to all site personnel | P. Horváth | 19 Sep | Complete |
| 8 | Review all lift plans for steel erection | BSS/SPCC | 23 Sep | In progress |

## 7. Lessons Learned

1. **Lift plans must be followed exactly.** Deviations require formal approval.

2. **Supervision is critical.** Lifting operations must not proceed without the appointed competent person present.

3. **Exclusion zones must be physically enforced.** Tape barriers are insufficient for extended lifting operations.

4. **Near-miss reporting is essential.** Previous similar events (sling slippage) were not reported.

## 8. Reporting

| Authority | Notification Required | Status |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| BEU | Yes (contractual) | Complete – 18 Sep |
| DPI | Yes (contractual) | Complete – 18 Sep |
| Borduria Labour Inspectorate | No (MTC not reportable) | N/A |
| Insurance | Yes | 19 Sep |
