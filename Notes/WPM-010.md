### 1. Review of Previous Minutes and Actions

Minutes of WPM-009 dated 10 April 2019 were approved without amendment.

**Action Review:**

### 2. Contaminated Soil - TCM Outcomes and Next Steps

D. Kostić reported on the Technical Coordination Meeting held on 12 April 2019:

**Key Decisions:**

1. **Remediation Approach:** Option A (Excavation and Off-Site Disposal) confirmed as the preferred approach by all parties
2. **Regulatory Notification:** BEU submitted notification to EPA on 15 April; acknowledgement received; inspection scheduled for 25 April
3. **Disposal Facility:** Szohôd Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility confirmed as receiving facility; preliminary acceptance received
4. **Contaminated Zone Boundary:** Agreed to be defined by 1,000 mg/kg TPH contour plus 2m buffer

**Outstanding Items:**

- Final remediation specification to be issued by BEU following EPA inspection
- Environmental monitoring plan required
- SPCC to provide detailed remediation methodology and programme

A. Kováč confirmed that SPCC is preparing the detailed methodology and expects to submit within 7 days of receiving BEU's specification.

D. Kostić noted that BEU is also obtaining quotations for disposal costs directly from Szohôd facility to verify the Contractor's estimates.

M. Santos reminded parties that time is of the essence given the potential programme impact.

**Action:** WPM-010/01 - D. Kostić to issue contaminated soil remediation specification following EPA inspection | Due: 30 April 2019

### 3. Earthworks Progress Update

P. Novotný presented earthworks progress:

**Completed This Week:**
- Topsoil stripping - Admin Building area: 100% complete (3,200 m³)
- Mass excavation - Admin Building: 35% complete (approximately 4,800 m³ of 13,500 m³)

**Productivity:**
- Actual: 480 m³/day average
- Planned: 450 m³/day
- Status: Ahead of plan

**Next Week:**
- Continue mass excavation Admin Building area
- Commence topsoil stripping - Cooling Tower area
- Prepare for NE area earthworks (laydown area)

M. Santos noted her observations from site inspection on 16 April and confirmed that the issues raised (stockpile management, temporary drainage) have been addressed.

T. Polák confirmed all survey data for Admin Building excavation has been submitted.

**Weather Forecast:** Good conditions expected through Easter period.

### 4. Design Status

In Dr. Braun's absence, A. Kováč provided the design update:

**Basic Design:**
- Batch 1: Approved with comments (DPI/SPCC/2019/0004 dated 12 April)
- Batch 2 Rev A: Submitted 12 April; under review
- Batch 3: Comments received 15 April; responses in preparation
- Batch 4: Comments expected 18 April

**GT1 Foundation:**
- Redesign required due to contamination/aquifer
- Alternative foundation solutions being evaluated:
  * Option 1: Deeper piles founding below aquifer
  * Option 2: Ground improvement (vibro replacement)
  * Option 3: Raft foundation with permanent dewatering
- Technical comparison to be presented at TCM scheduled for 26 April

D. Kostić emphasised that BEU will require a robust foundation solution that does not create long-term operational complications (e.g., permanent dewatering).

**Action:** WPM-010/02 - A. Kováč to present GT1 foundation alternatives at TCM-002 | Due: 26 April 2019

### 5. Civil Works Subcontractor Mobilisation

P. Novotný reported on BCC mobilisation planning:

- Contract award letter issued 12 April 2019
- Pre-mobilisation meeting held 15 April
- Key personnel identified: Nikola Đurić (General Manager), Goran Stanković (Site Foreman)
- Mobilisation date confirmed: 1 May 2019
- Initial scope: Piling operations (Admin Building and HRSG areas)
- Equipment: 2 piling rigs, support equipment
- Labour: 25-30 personnel initially

**Coordination Items:**
- Site induction scheduled 29-30 April (2 days before mobilisation)
- Laydown area to be prepared in NE area
- Temporary power connection for piling equipment required
- BCC to provide detailed method statements by 25 April

B. Simić confirmed BEU has no concerns with the BCC mobilisation arrangements.

**Action:** WPM-010/03 - J. Svoboda to confirm temporary power connection arrangements for BCC | Due: 26 April 2019

### 6. Programme Update

M. Dvořák presented programme status:

**Overall Status:**
- Earned Value: 2.8% complete (planned 3.1%)
- Schedule Performance Index: 0.90
- Days behind programme: 6 days (increased from 4 days last week)

**Critical Path:**
- Currently through: Design → GT procurement → GT installation → Commissioning
- Emerging risk: GT1 foundation may become critical if remediation/redesign extends

**Float Status:**
- Original float to completion: 15 days
- Current float: 9 days

**Key Schedule Risks:**

| Risk | Potential Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Contamination remediation | 8-10 weeks | Accelerate EPA process; parallel working |
| GT1 foundation redesign | 4-6 weeks | Fast-track design; pre-order piling |
| Design approval delays | 2-4 weeks | Increase review resources |

D. Kostić noted that the schedule erosion is concerning and requested SPCC present concrete recovery measures at PMM-004.

M. Horák acknowledged the concerns and confirmed SPCC is developing mitigation plans.

### 7. HSE Matters

J. Svoboda presented the HSE report:

- Man-hours worked this week: 1,624
- LTI: 0
- Incidents: 0
- Near Misses: 1 (excavation edge - immediately corrected)
- Toolbox talks: 5 delivered

**Easter Period:**
- Reduced operations 19-22 April
- Security maintained 24/7
- Emergency contact numbers distributed

B. Simić requested that BEU HSE Manager (Dejan Ilić) be included in emergency contact list for Easter period.

**Action:** WPM-010/04 - J. Svoboda to update emergency contact list to include D. Ilić | Due: 18 April 2019

### 8. Any Other Business

**Basic Design Approval Milestone:**

M. Horák noted that the contractual milestone for Basic Design Approval (15 April 2019) was not achieved. He stated that SPCC considers this delay is substantially attributable to the design review process and ground conditions issues, and that SPCC reserves its rights accordingly.

D. Kostić responded that BEU considers the delay to be primarily due to the quality of initial design submissions requiring multiple review cycles. He noted this matter would be addressed separately.

M. Santos noted the positions of both parties for the record and encouraged resolution of this matter outside the weekly progress meeting.

**EPA Inspection (25 April):**

D. Kostić advised that SPCC personnel should be available to accompany the EPA inspector if required. A. Kováč confirmed he would be available.

### 9. Next Meeting

Wednesday, 24 April 2019, 09:00, Site Office Conference Room A

**Note:** WPM-011 will proceed despite Easter period; attendance may be reduced.
