**Subject: Notice of Full Site Access - North-Eastern Area**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001; Sub-Clause 2.1 (Right of Access to the Site)**

Dear Mr. Horák,

**1. PURPOSE**

Further to the partial Site possession provided on 1 February 2019 and our email communication of 1 April 2019, we hereby provide formal notice that full access to the Site, including the previously excluded 2.1 hectare area in the north-eastern corner, is now available to the Contractor.

**2. BACKGROUND**

As recorded in our letter BEU/SPCC/2019/0002-GEN dated 1 February 2019, access to the north-eastern portion of the Site was temporarily restricted pending resolution of a boundary easement matter with the adjacent landowner, Klow Chemical Works.

**3. CONFIRMATION OF ACCESS**

We confirm the following:

(a) The easement agreement with Klow Chemical Works was formally registered with the Municipal Land Registry on 1 April 2019 (Registration No. KLW-2019-0342).

(b) Full and unrestricted access to the entire 25-hectare Site is available to the Contractor with effect from **2 April 2019**.

(c) The temporary fencing delineating the exclusion zone has been removed.

(d) No access restrictions of any kind remain in effect.

**4. CONTRACTOR'S CLAIM**

We acknowledge receipt of your notice dated 18 February 2019 (Reference: SPCC/BEU/2019/0004-COM) regarding potential entitlements arising from the restricted Site access. This matter will be addressed separately by our Contracts Administrator in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.

**5. COORDINATION**

Mr. Branko Simić (BEU Site Representative) is available to coordinate any access arrangements with your Site team. Please contact him directly at +389 70 555 789 or branko.simic@beu.bd.

We trust this resolves the Site access matter and look forward to continued progress on the Works.

Yours sincerely,

**Ivana Petrović**
Project Manager
