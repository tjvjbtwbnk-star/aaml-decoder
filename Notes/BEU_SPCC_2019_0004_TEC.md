Dear Mr. Kováč,

## RE: BORDURIA COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANT PROJECT – APPROVAL OF GROUND INVESTIGATION PROGRAMME

We acknowledge receipt of your letter ref. SPCC/BEU/2019/0004-TEC dated 5 February 2019, submitting the Ground Investigation Programme for our review and approval.

Having reviewed the proposed programme with our technical team and the Engineer, we are pleased to **approve** the Ground Investigation Programme as submitted, subject to the clarifications and conditions noted below.

**Approved Documents:**
- Ground Investigation Programme (SPCC-CI-001, Rev 0)
- Borehole Location Plan (SPCC-CI-101, Rev A)
- Testing Schedule and Laboratory Requirements

**Scope Confirmation:**

The proposed investigation scope is appropriate and adequate for the design requirements:
- 24 boreholes at strategic locations across the site
- Adequate depth range (15-35m) for foundation design
- Appropriate in-situ and laboratory testing programme
- Groundwater monitoring provisions

We have reviewed the borehole locations with the Engineer and confirm they are well-positioned to characterize the site conditions for the major structures and equipment foundations.

**Contractor Approval:**

We have no objection to the use of Balkan Geotechnical Services Ltd. as the drilling contractor. BGS is known to us and has performed satisfactory work on previous power sector projects in Borduria.

**Schedule Approval:**

The proposed schedule is acceptable:
- Mobilisation: 18 February 2019
- Drilling operations: 18 February - 15 March 2019
- Laboratory testing: Progressive to 30 March 2019
- Final Geotechnical Report: 15 April 2019

This schedule is compatible with the overall project programme and maintains the foundation design approval milestone of mid-April.

## CLARIFICATIONS AND CONDITIONS

**1. Northeastern Site Area - Access Arrangements**

We acknowledge SPCC's requirement to access the northeastern area for drilling 6 boreholes in that zone (approximately 5 days of work).

**Status Update:** Following discussions with Klow Chemical Works, we have arranged **temporary access** specifically for ground investigation drilling operations. The access arrangement is as follows:

**Access Period:** 25 February - 8 March 2019 (10 working days - sufficient for your 5-day requirement plus contingency)

**Access Conditions:**
- SPCC must provide 48 hours advance notice before entering the NE area
- Maximum 2 vehicles at any time in that area
- Drilling operations to be conducted during normal working hours only (07:00 - 17:00 weekdays)
- SPCC responsible for all safety, security, and environmental controls
- Any damage to existing features must be made good immediately
- Klow Chemical Works reserves right to suspend access if safety concerns arise

**Liability Insurance:** SPCC must provide certificate of insurance covering operations in the NE area (minimum EUR 5 million public liability). Please provide this to Branko Simić before 25 February.

**Coordination:** Branko Simić will coordinate access logistics with Klow Chemical Works site security. Contact: Mr. Jovan Popović (Security Manager), tel: +387 33 654 321.

This temporary access arrangement is independent of the permanent site possession matter, which is still being negotiated. The permanent access issue is expected to be resolved by end of March.

**2. Utility Clearances**

We have reviewed available utility records and confirm:
- No known buried utilities exist at the proposed borehole locations
- The eastern site boundary (where several boreholes are located) has overhead power lines - minimum clearance 10m must be maintained for drilling rig operations
- If any utilities are unexpectedly encountered during drilling, stop work immediately and notify Branko Simić

**Utility Plan:** A marked-up site plan showing known utilities is attached (Drawing BEU-SP-005).

**3. Archaeological Watching Brief**

Dr. Ivana Stojković (appointed archaeologist) has been notified of the ground investigation schedule. The archaeological watching brief requirements are as follows:

**Notification Required:** SPCC must provide 48 hours notice before commencing drilling at each new borehole location. This allows Dr. Stojković to attend if she determines it necessary.

**Dr. Stojković will attend:** 
- First borehole (initial site inspection and methodology verification)
- Any boreholes where potentially sensitive areas are encountered
- On request if unusual findings are reported

**She will not routinely attend:** Every borehole location (this would be unnecessarily costly and time-consuming)

**Procedure if archaeological materials found:**
- Stop drilling immediately
- Protect the area
- Notify Dr. Stojković and Branko Simić immediately
- Allow archaeological assessment before proceeding

**Contact:** Dr. Ivana Stojković, mobile: +387 65 123 4567, email: i.stojkovic@archaeology-bd.com

**4. Health, Safety and Environmental Requirements**

We have reviewed Balkan Geotechnical Services' HSE plan and find it acceptable. Additional requirements:

**Daily Coordination:** The drilling crew must attend SPCC's daily toolbox talks and follow all site HSE procedures.

**Environmental Protection:**
- All drilling fluids and cuttings must be properly contained and disposed of in accordance with Bordurian environmental regulations
- Spill kits must be available at all drilling locations
- Any fuel or oil spills must be reported immediately to Peter Horváth (SPCC HSE Manager) and Dejan Ilić (BEU HSE Manager)

**Waste Disposal:** SPCC is responsible for arranging appropriate disposal of drilling waste. Licensed waste contractor must be used. Waste disposal certificates to be provided to BEU.

**5. Geotechnical Report Requirements**

We confirm the deliverables specified in your programme are acceptable. The Final Geotechnical Report (due 15 April) should specifically address:

**Foundation Design Parameters:**
- Allowable bearing pressures for shallow foundations (at various depths)
- Recommendations for deep foundation systems if required (pile types, capacities, depths)
- Settlement estimates for various foundation loading conditions
- Recommendations for foundation construction methodology

**Ground Water Management:**
- Groundwater level variations (seasonal)
- Dewatering requirements for excavations
- Impact on temporary and permanent works
- Foundation drainage requirements

**Excavation Considerations:**
- Soil excavation characteristics and equipment requirements
- Temporary excavation stability and shoring requirements
- Risk of collapse or base heave
- Disposal classification for excavated materials

**Concrete Durability:**
- Aggressive chemical assessment (sulfates, chlorides)
- Concrete specification requirements to resist ground/groundwater attack
- Any special protective measures required

**Pavement Design:** 
- CBR values for roads and laydown areas
- Subgrade improvement requirements if needed
- Recommendations for pavement construction

**Construction Issues:**
- Any special construction considerations or challenges
- Geotechnical risk assessment
- Recommendations for construction monitoring and testing

The report should be prepared in accordance with Eurocode 7 (Geotechnical Design) and Bordurian Building Code 2015.

**6. Progress Reporting**

Please provide weekly progress updates on the ground investigation as part of the weekly progress meetings. Updates should include:
- Number of boreholes completed
- Any unexpected ground conditions encountered
- Any delays or issues
- Laboratory testing progress
- Forecast completion date

**7. Quality Assurance**

We request that the Engineer's Resident Engineer (Maria Santos) be given notice of drilling operations and be permitted to observe drilling and sampling procedures at her discretion. This is for quality assurance purposes and to allow the Engineer to develop familiarity with the site conditions.

Laboratory testing should be conducted by a BELAC (Bordurian Laboratory Accreditation Council) accredited laboratory or equivalent international accreditation. Please provide laboratory accreditation certificates with the geotechnical report.
