---

Dear Ondřej,

Thank you for arranging my attendance at the HRSG Area Foundation Pour 4 inspection and subsequent concrete placement today. I am pleased to report that the pour proceeded satisfactorily overall. However, I wish to record the following observations for your attention and action as necessary.

**Inspection Details**
- Date: 11 July 2019
- Location: HRSG Foundation Area, Section HF-04
- Time: Pre-pour inspection 06:30; Pour commenced 07:15; Pour completed 14:30
- Volume: 245 m³
- Weather: Clear, temperature 28°C at start rising to 34°C at completion

**Positive Observations**

1. Formwork alignment and condition satisfactory
2. Rebar installation compliant with drawings (spot check of bar sizes, spacings, and cover)
3. Embedded items correctly positioned and secured
4. Concrete delivery maintained without significant delays
5. Vibration and compaction appeared thorough
6. Curing compound application commenced within 30 minutes of finishing

**Observations Requiring Attention**

1. **Concrete Temperature:** I noted that Truck 7 (arriving at approximately 11:45) recorded a delivery temperature of 29°C, which is close to the specified maximum of 30°C. Given the ambient temperatures, I recommend additional ice be added to afternoon deliveries during this hot period to provide greater margin.

2. **Curing Water Application:** There was a delay of approximately 45 minutes between the initial curing compound application and the commencement of misting on the eastern section of the pour. While the curing compound provides initial protection, please ensure misting commences promptly to avoid any risk of plastic shrinkage cracking in these conditions.

3. **Construction Joint Preparation:** The construction joint at the interface with Pour 3 appeared to have some surface laitance that was not fully removed prior to placing. I observed the team wire-brushing the surface during the pour, but ideally this should have been completed the day before and inspected prior to pour commencement.

4. **Cube Sample Labelling:** I noted that two cube samples (from Truck 5) were initially mislabelled. This was corrected on site, but please reinforce the importance of accurate sample identification with the testing laboratory personnel.

**Recommendations**

1. For all remaining pours during this hot weather period, please consider:
   - Starting pours at 06:00 or earlier where practical
   - Pre-cooling formwork with water spray before placing
   - Increasing ice addition to maintain delivery temperature below 27°C

2. Please brief the BCC team on construction joint preparation requirements – the joint surface should be prepared, cleaned, and inspected the day before the pour.

3. Please confirm the cube sample labelling correction has been documented in your quality records.

None of the above observations are considered to constitute non-conformances at this stage, but I wanted to bring them to your attention for continuous improvement purposes.

I will attend the Pour 5 inspection scheduled for 15 July as discussed. Please advise if there are any changes to the schedule.

Best regards,
