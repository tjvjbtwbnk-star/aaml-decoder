# TECHNICAL REPORT

| | |
|---|---|
| **Report No.:** | TR-009 |
| **Title:** | GT1 Foundation Slab – Concrete Strength Investigation (Preliminary) |
| **Date:** | 30 September 2019 |
| **Prepared by:** | Andrej Kováč, Lead Civil Engineer, SPCC |
| **Reviewed by:** | Dr. Wilhelm Braun, Engineering Manager, SPCC |
| **Project:** | Borduria Combined Cycle Power Plant |
| **Status:** | PRELIMINARY – Pending Core Test Results |

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the investigation into a failed concrete cube test result from the GT1 foundation slab. One of six cube samples returned a 28-day strength of 36 MPa against a specified minimum of 40 MPa. Core testing is underway to determine actual in-situ strength.

**Preliminary Findings:**
- Single cube failure from western slab area
- Five of six cubes passed with significant margin (47-55 MPa)
- Pour records indicate extended duration and potential issues in west area
- Core testing underway – results expected 7 October (accelerated) and 28 October (standard)

**Preliminary Assessment:**
- If cores confirm ≥40 MPa: No action required
- If cores confirm 36-39 MPa: May be acceptable with design reassessment
- If cores confirm <36 MPa: Remediation will be required

## 2. Background

### 2.1 GT1 Foundation Slab

The GT1 foundation slab is a critical structural element supporting:
- Gas turbine unit (~350 tonnes)
- Inlet and exhaust systems
- Associated equipment and piping

**Design Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Slab dimensions | 18m × 12m × 1.2m thick |
| Concrete grade | C40/50 |
| Characteristic strength (fck) | 40 MPa |
| Reinforcement | B500B, top and bottom |
| Pour date | 28 August 2019 |
| Pour volume | 420 m³ |

### 2.2 Concrete Specification

The concrete was specified as C40/50 with high-early-strength characteristics to support the accelerated construction programme. The mix design was approved by DPI on 15 July 2019.

**Mix Design Summary:**

| Component | Quantity |
|-----------|----------|
| CEM I 52.5R | 400 kg/m³ |
| Coarse aggregate (10-20mm) | 1,050 kg/m³ |
| Fine aggregate (0-4mm) | 680 kg/m³ |
| Water | 170 litres/m³ |
| Superplasticiser | 4.0 litres/m³ |
| w/c ratio | 0.425 |
| Target slump | 150 ± 30 mm |

## 3. Pour Record Review

### 3.1 Pour Sequence

The pour commenced at 06:30 on 28 August 2019 and was completed at 17:30 – a duration of 11 hours against a planned duration of 8 hours.

**Pour Sequence:**

| Time | Activity | Area | Volume |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| 06:30 | Pour commenced | North | - |
| 06:30-09:00 | North section | North | 120 m³ |
| 09:00-09:45 | Pump line blockage | - | - |
| 09:45-12:30 | East and centre | East/Centre | 150 m³ |
| 12:30-13:00 | Lunch break | - | - |
| 13:00-15:00 | South section | South | 100 m³ |
| 15:00-17:30 | West section | West | 50 m³ |
| 17:30 | Pour complete | - | 420 m³ |

### 3.2 Issues Recorded

The pour log records the following issues:

| Time | Issue | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 09:15 | Concrete delivery rejected (high slump) | 8 m³ returned |
| 09:30 | Pump line blockage | Cleared after 45 mins |
| 14:00 | Traffic delay – 3 trucks late | 30 min wait |
| 15:45 | Second pump line blockage | 25 min delay |

### 3.3 West Area Observations

The west area was the last section poured (15:00-17:30). Relevant observations:

1. **Extended placement time:** Concrete in trucks waiting during pump blockage may have begun initial set.

2. **Late afternoon timing:** Higher ambient temperature, faster moisture loss.

3. **Edge location:** Limited vibrator access near formwork edges.

4. **No recorded water addition:** Pour log does not record any water addition, but this cannot be definitively excluded.

## 4. Cube Test Analysis

### 4.1 Results Summary

| Sample | Location | 7-day (MPa) | 28-day (MPa) | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| FDN-GT1-001 | North | 45 | 52 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-002 | East | 48 | 55 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-003 | Centre | 42 | 51 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-004 | South | 38 | 47 | Pass |
| FDN-GT1-005 | West | 32 | 36 | **Fail** |
| FDN-GT1-006 | SW Corner | 44 | 53 | Pass |

### 4.2 Statistical Analysis

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mean | 49.0 MPa |
| Standard deviation | 6.8 MPa |
| Coefficient of variation | 13.9% |
| Minimum | 36 MPa |
| Maximum | 55 MPa |

The coefficient of variation (13.9%) is higher than typical for well-controlled concrete production (typically 8-12%), suggesting some variability in the pour.

### 4.3 Spatial Pattern

The results show a clear spatial pattern:
- North/East/Centre: High strength (51-55 MPa)
- South: Moderate strength (47 MPa)
- West: Low strength (36 MPa)

This pattern is consistent with declining strength towards the later-poured areas, suggesting time-related degradation.

## 5. Core Testing Programme

### 5.1 Core Locations

Six cores were drilled on 27-28 September 2019:

| Core | Grid Reference | Distance from Cube 005 | Depth |
|------|----------------|------------------------|-------|
| C1 | W3/A | 0m (cube location) | 150mm |
| C2 | W3/B | 2m north | 150mm |
| C3 | W2/A | 3m east | 150mm |
| C4 | W4/A | 3m west | 150mm |
| C5 | W3/C | 4m north | 150mm |
| C6 | W2/B | 4m northeast | 150mm |

### 5.2 Testing Programme

| Test | Method | Duration | Results Expected |
|------|--------|----------|------------------|
| Accelerated | BS 1881-112 | 7 days | 7 October 2019 |
| Standard | BS EN 12504-1 | 28 days | 28 October 2019 |

### 5.3 Acceptance Criteria

Per BS EN 13791, the in-situ characteristic strength is acceptable if:

**For ≥6 cores:**
- f_ck,is ≥ 0.85 × f_ck × (1 + 1.48 × V_δ)^(-1)

Where V_δ is the coefficient of variation of core results.

For f_ck = 40 MPa and assuming V_δ = 0.10:
- Minimum acceptable mean core strength ≈ 36.5 MPa

## 6. Structural Assessment

### 6.1 Design Basis

The GT1 foundation slab was designed for:

| Load Case | Load (kN) | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| GT dead load | 3,430 | 350 tonnes |
| Auxiliaries | 1,200 | Inlet, exhaust, piping |
| Operating loads | 500 | Dynamic, thermal |
| **Total** | **5,130** | |

Design bearing pressure: 180 kPa (on pile caps)
Design concrete stress: Max 12 MPa (compression)

### 6.2 Sensitivity Analysis

| Scenario | In-situ fck | Design Capacity | Utilisation | Acceptable? |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Original design | 40 MPa | 100% | 45% | Yes |
| Scenario B | 38 MPa | 95% | 47% | Yes |
| Scenario C | 35 MPa | 88% | 51% | Marginal |
| Scenario D | 32 MPa | 80% | 56% | No |

### 6.3 Preliminary Conclusion

If the in-situ strength is confirmed at 36-38 MPa (as suggested by the cube test), the foundation may still be acceptable with a reduced factor of safety. However, this would require formal design reassessment and approval by the Engineer.

## 7. Remediation Options

If remediation is required, the following options have been identified:

### 7.1 Option 1: Epoxy Injection and Surface Treatment

- Inject low-viscosity epoxy to improve concrete matrix
- Apply surface hardener to increase surface strength
- **Cost estimate:** EUR 15,000-25,000
- **Programme impact:** 5-7 days
- **Effectiveness:** Limited – may not address structural capacity

### 7.2 Option 2: Local Removal and Replacement

- Remove defective concrete to depth of 300mm
- Replace with high-strength repair mortar
- **Cost estimate:** EUR 40,000-60,000
- **Programme impact:** 10-14 days
- **Effectiveness:** Good – restores design capacity locally

### 7.3 Option 3: Structural Enhancement

- Install additional reinforcement (CFRP strips or steel plates)
- Provides additional capacity without concrete removal
- **Cost estimate:** EUR 80,000-120,000
- **Programme impact:** 14-21 days
- **Effectiveness:** Excellent – exceeds original capacity

### 7.4 Option 4: Full Slab Replacement

- Remove and replace entire west section of slab
- **Cost estimate:** EUR 250,000-350,000
- **Programme impact:** 6-8 weeks
- **Effectiveness:** Complete – but disproportionate if localised issue

## 8. Programme Implications

### 8.1 GT1 Delivery

GT1 shipping is scheduled for 15 October 2019 with site arrival mid-November. This is not affected by the investigation.

### 8.2 GT1 Installation

GT1 installation is scheduled for Q1 2020. The foundation must be certified fit for purpose before installation.

| Scenario | Remediation | Programme Impact |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Cores pass | None | No impact |
| Minor remediation | Option 1 or 2 | 1-2 weeks |
| Major remediation | Option 3 | 2-3 weeks |
| Replacement | Option 4 | 6-8 weeks (critical) |

## 9. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 9.1 Conclusions

1. One cube test from the GT1 foundation slab has failed the 28-day strength requirement.

2. The failure appears localised to the western slab area, which was poured last under challenging conditions.

3. Core testing is required to confirm actual in-situ strength.

4. Preliminary structural assessment indicates the foundation may be acceptable at reduced strength, subject to formal reassessment.

### 9.2 Recommendations

1. **Await core test results** before determining course of action.

2. **Prepare remediation plans** for Options 1-3 to enable rapid response if required.

3. **Notify TurboMach** of potential programme risk to GT1 installation.

4. **Conduct root cause analysis** regardless of core results to prevent recurrence.
