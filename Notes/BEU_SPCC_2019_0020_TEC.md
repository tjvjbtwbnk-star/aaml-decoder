**Subject: Electrical Design – Grid Connection Data Required**

**Reference: Contract No. BEU-BCCPP-2018-001**

Dear Dr. Braun,

We refer to the discussions at recent Design Task Force meetings and Weekly Progress Meetings regarding the grid connection data required for detailed electrical design.

**1. Background**

1.1 The Contractor has requested certain grid stability and technical data from the Transmission System Operator (TSO) through the Employer. This data is required to finalise the detailed electrical design, specifically:

- Grid fault level at 400kV connection point
- Grid impedance characteristics
- System frequency variation data
- Grid voltage profile (operating range)
- Protection coordination requirements

1.2 We understand that this data was originally requested in March 2019 with delivery expected in June 2019.

**2. Current Status**

2.1 We acknowledge that the provision of this data has been delayed beyond the originally expected timeframe.

2.2 The Employer has been pursuing this data with the TSO and has escalated the request to TSO management level. We have received assurances that the data will be provided.

2.3 We are advised by the TSO that the data will be available by **30 August 2019**.

**3. Employer's Position**

3.1 The Employer notes that under the Contract, the Contractor is responsible for the design of the Works, including all interface coordination with third parties.

3.2 Sub-Clause 5.1 states that the Contractor shall be responsible for the design of the Works and for the accuracy of such design.

3.3 The Employer's role in facilitating communication with the TSO does not transfer design responsibility or risk to the Employer.

3.4 The Contractor is expected to proceed with design development using reasonable assumptions where specific data is not yet available, and to adjust the design as necessary when data is received.

**4. Request**

4.1 Please provide the following information:

(a) Confirmation of the design assumptions being used in the absence of TSO data;

(b) Assessment of the risk that actual TSO data will differ materially from assumptions;

(c) Identification of any design decisions that cannot be made without the TSO data;

(d) Assessment of the programme impact of the current situation.

4.2 Please provide this information by **22 August 2019**.

**5. Next Steps**

5.1 The Employer will continue to pursue the TSO data and will provide updates as they become available.

5.2 If the Contractor considers that any delay in receiving this data constitutes a basis for Extension of Time or additional cost, the Contractor should submit appropriate notice under the Contract.

5.3 We suggest that a technical meeting be arranged between SPCC electrical design team and BEU/TSO representatives once the data is available to ensure efficient incorporation into the design.

We remain committed to supporting the Contractor in obtaining the necessary information and look forward to receiving the requested assessment.

Yours sincerely,

**Dragan Kostić**
